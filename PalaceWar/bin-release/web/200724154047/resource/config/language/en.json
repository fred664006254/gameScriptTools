"challengeDesc1":"You return home with the title First Talent under your belt. As you travel across the busy streets with joy, you run straight into a local bully...",
"challengeDesc2":"To everyone's surprise, Zhao Hu (Warden, RANK 1) breaks the imperial laws in front of the new First Talent's mansion. You arrest him because he's basically asking for it.",
"challengeDesc3":"The next day, you arrive at Zhao Qun's (Censor, RANK 1) mansion. You and your man arrest him with pincer attack!",
"challengeDesc4":"Seizing Zhao Qun and freeing the folks locked up in Zhao's dungeons were supposed to be good deeds. But as soon as you come home, you receive a threating letter, telling you to mind your own business!",
"challengeDesc5":"The drought and locusts are plaguing Jianghuai area, causing drastic damage to local agriculture. You decide to seek Tang Bohu's help...",
"challengeDesc6":"Liu Gen (County Mayor, RANK 2) attempts to embezzle official relief supplies. Si Qi'er bravely stands out to set the greedy mayor and his men back!",
"challengeDesc7":"Su Qi'er has risked his life convoying the relief supplies to the village. You assemble the villagers and distribute the grains to them all.",
"challengeDesc8":"You are aware of your lack of good fighters, so you order Yuan Fang to post a recruitment notification. Yet before you manage to find anyone suitable, your enemy sends an assassin on you...",
"challengeDesc9":"Having found yourself in bed at home as you wake up from a coma, you immediately send people to find out where Shan Ji lives. After Su Qi'er locates him the next day, you visit him with gratitude.",
"challengeDesc10":"After saving your life, Shan Ji (Cavalry Captain, RANK 3) sets off to the County Hall to discuss with Feng Yuntian (County Governor, RANK 4) about your safety.",
"challengeDesc11":"After hearing Shan Ji out, Feng Yuntian agrees to protect you, the new First Talent, under the table.",
"challengeDesc12":"After visiting Shan's Mansion multiple times, you finally have the honor to meet the chivalrous Sir Shan. You present him the premium sword you forged specially for him as a gift.",
"challengeDesc13":"Shan Ji (Guard Captain, RANK 3) invites you in and uncovers his relationship with Qian De (Vanguard Captain, RANK 3) to you. Everyone is astonished!",
"challengeDesc14":"After knowing what Shan Ji did for you, you decide to become sworn brothers with him. Meanwhile, you receive an invitation to Qian De's mother's 80th birthday banquet.",
"challengeDesc15":"Shan Ji shows up right after you send the invitation deliveryman away and discusses the birthday banquet with you. Your thoughts impress him greatly.",
"challengeDesc16":"The journey can be dangerous, the entire family is worried about you...",
"challengeDesc17":"Shan Ji travels overnight to seek Feng Yuntian's help and he immediately sets off with the authoritative seal. Meanwhile, Shan Ji gets the silver ingots delivery going. Everything proceeds as planned.",
"challengeDesc18":"You set out early in the morning and stay in a tavern for the night. Unexpectedly, Qian De's sworn brother, Zhang Cheng (Chiliarch, RANK 3), has set an ambush here. But you arrest him anyway.",
"challengeDesc19":"At the banquet, Qian De demands you to release Zhang Cheng. Meanwhile, Feng Yuntian arrives at the venue and ferrets out the embezzled silver ingots. Accordingly, Qian De is under arrest.",
"challengeDesc20":"After working together to arrest Qian De, You, Shan Ji and Feng Yuntian form an alliance.",
"challengeDesc21":"Recently, several rich families' ancestral graves were robbed one after another. The Imperial Court orders you to look deep into it.",
"challengeDesc22":"The next day, you go to seek, Minister of Etiquette, Zheng De's help regarding these grave robberies. But Zheng De's butler shuts you out before you get to meet him.",
"challengeDesc23":"You find the local Minister of Etiquette's behavior suspicious, so you ask Su Qi'er to stake him out.",
"challengeDesc24":"Su Qi'er finds out that there's something fishy about the minister's mansion. When you visit him again, his butler weirdly gives you a warm welcome this time.",
"challengeDesc25":"You finally get to meet Zheng De. What he does next, however, greatly surprises you...",
"challengeDesc26":"Zhang De drives the servants away to gift you a jade ware. Holding doubts against Zhang De, you decide to play along and accept the gift. Later, you, Shan Ji and Lord Feng have a discussion together.",
"challengeDesc27":"The next day, you find a merchant in town who is a die-hard jade-lover and ask him to play possum. Also, you find a grave builder.",
"challengeDesc28":"After the grave is built, you go to inform Zheng De that the salt merchant is dead.",
"challengeDesc29":"Just as expected, after the news slips out of your mouth, Zhang De decides to raid the grave on the same day the merchant gets buried.",
"challengeDesc30":"You wait until around midnight, Zhang De and his gang are on the move...",
"challengeDesc31":"After Zhang De and his gang enter the grave, you quietly flip a switch to shut the door. The grave robbers have become fishes in a barrel.",
"challengeDesc32":"Right after the grave robbery mayhem is handled, a sudden plague of malaria brings calamity upon civilians.",
"challengeDesc33":"Feng Yuntian and Shan Ji's soldiers are more or less stricken with the epidemic. No one in town is capable of curing malaria, you send Su Qi'er to the capital to seek the Imperial Doctors' help.",
"challengeDesc34":"Two days later, Su Qi'er comes back with Imperial Doctor Zhang Guangyang (Imperial Doctor, RANK 6) to diagnose and prescribe the patients.",
"challengeDesc35":"However, Imperial Doctor Zhang Guangyang spends his days having fun in the name of searching for herbs. Not until the plague worsens, does he brings the remedy from the capital.",
"challengeDesc36":"It seems gastrodia, a kind of herb that is supposed to be the remedy, from the Imperial Court isn't working at all!",
"challengeDesc37":"Su Qi'er, who is on the mission of stalking Zhang Guangyang, runs into the salt merchant's daughter, whose malaria seems to have been cured.",
"challengeDesc38":"You begin to have doubts about the remedy from the Imperial Court. You call Doctor Tan here to authenticate it, the so-called remedy turns out to be a nonmedical herb.",
"challengeDesc39":"Thus, you decide to keep a closer eye on Zhang Guangyang to find out where the real gastrodia went.",
"challengeDesc40":"Ji Xiaolan comes across Zhang Guangyang at Blossom Club. According to the hostess, Madam Hua, Li Laocai (Minister of Transport, RANK 7) helped him deliver gastrodia to Rong Town.",
"challengeDesc41":"Now that you have learned that they swapped the real gastrodia with common herbs, you once again request for the remedy from the Imperial Court. Then you follow Zhang Guangyang stealthily.",
"challengeDesc42":"On Zhang Guangyang's way back to town, he stops by a tavern for the swapping again. Once the intel is confirmed, you and your men rush to catch him in the act.",
"challengeDesc43":"After arresting Zhang Guangyang, you decoct the real herbs for folks to drink. Within three days, the patients begin to recover...",
"challengeDesc44":"Li Laocai, worried that Zhang Guangyang would sell him out in jail, sends someone to assassinate Imperial Doctor Zhang...",
"challengeDesc45":"After the assassination fails, the assassin, a seemingly dauntless and loyal guy, gets terrified and snitches when Su Qi'er threatens to dismember him.",
"challengeDesc46":"Zhang Guangyang is disappointed in Li Laocai once he learns that he attempts to have him murdered, he's finally willing to tell you the current whereabouts of the herbs.",
"challengeDesc47":"On the market day, Yuan Fang pretends to be a apothecary to lure Li Laocai out. In the end, you catch the culprit on the spot!",
"challengeDesc48":"After solving several cases, you are now highly esteemed by the civilians. Upon the Emperor's South Tour in March, Prince Baylor pre-checks the route and you are the sole company by his secret order.",
"challengeDesc49":"As you pass by an embroidery house, you notice an embroideress working on an embroidery of a knight hunting a tiger. Prince Baylor intends to buy it, yet the embroideress says...",
"challengeDesc50":"According to the embroideress and the teahouse tender, Zhao Kang (Administrator, RANK 8) owns lots of privileges around this area. And there you learn more about his nickname, the Gold Bucket.",
"challengeDesc51":"You become interested in Zhao Kang's background, and teahouse tender doesn't mind at all telling you what he knows.",
"challengeDesc52":"Not long ago, Zhao Kang happened to find Qian Hutu, Mayor of Kunshan County, dozing off on the desk during his monthly visit. Zhao Kang dismissed Qian Hutu even though he took the bribery from him.",
"challengeDesc53":"You plan to regulate Zhao Kang, but soon, you are told that this guy's father Zhao An was the emperor's childhood study pal.",
"challengeDesc54":"Over the years, the Imperial March always stops by Zhao's mansion during the South Tours. Zhao Kang's network of royal connections is solid, no one in town wants trouble with the Zhaos!",
"challengeDesc55":"During the South Tour, Zhao Kang wouldn't have the nerve to collect money but his butler comes up with an stupid idea of exploiting civilians under the pretense of constructing a temple.",
"challengeDesc56":"The next day, the butler posts an announcement on the city gates. As the entire city whines and complains, you happen to pass by the gate...",
"challengeDesc57":"You decide that it'll be a great opportunity to put Zhao Kang to justice. You return to the tavern to make plans.",
"challengeDesc58":"Since you don't know anyone with military power in Yangzhou, you send a carrier pigeon with a message to Shan Ji, asking him to aid you in the arrest of Zhao Kang.",
"challengeDesc59":"3 days later, Zhao Kang takes a big group of soldiers to levy taxes and grains door to door. You try to stop them but you get surrounded. Shan Ji arrives timely to rescue you.",
"challengeDesc60":"You are outnumbered but Zhao Kang's men are weak, Shan Ji's elite soldiers beat them all up. It happens so fast that Zhao Kang doesn't even know who's arresting him!",
"challengeDesc61":"You take Zhao Kang back to his mansion for a trial. The man is probably laughing inside, “Aren't you stupid enough to bring me back to my house? Just you wait and see how I smash you!“",
"challengeDesc62":"Zhao An, in the meantime, is writing something at home. Drawn out by the commotion, he hears his son crying, “Dad, save me! Kill these dirty bastards!“",
"challengeDesc63":"Zhao Kang yells, “How dare you take me captive, do you know I'm the administrator of this city?“ And he adds, “Let me go and I'll spare your lives!“",
"challengeDesc64":"Prince Baylor then takes out his token and says, “Zhao An, look! Do you recognize this?“ Zhao An starts to shake after taking a close look.",
"challengeDesc65":"Before Zhao An says a word, Prince Baylor continues, “I'm Lord Pang, you keep a low profile. I want minimum people involved.“ Zhao An says, “You lot, leave us, go away!“",
"challengeDesc66":"Zhao Kang, who is kneeling next to them, is still in confusion and screams, “Dad, help, help!“",
"challengeDesc67":"[Zhao Kang may be a delinquent but his father has done nothing wrong. Zhao An kneels and pleads, “Lord Pang, sorry for having done a bad job raising my son. What crime has this kid committed?“]",
"challengeDesc68":"[Clarify the reason.]",
"challengeDesc69":"I just want to help develop this area. That's not a crime, is it?",
"challengeDesc70":"“Shut up!“ Zhao An roar, “You put our family to shame! I can't believe I have brought up a scoundrel son like you!“",
"challengeDesc71":"[Zhao An knows his son won't be sentenced to death but to keep this thing down, he scolds Zhao Kang and sends him to jail.]",
"challengeDesc72":"And then Zhao An asks everyone to leave and whispers to Prince Baylor, “Sorry for being unaware of your arrival, Your Highness, please forgive my bad manners!“",
"challengeDesc73":"[Zhao An seems an incorruptible official, Prince Baylor says, “I'm pre-checking the South Tour route for His Majesty. Don't you let the word out, call me Pang Jian in public from now on.“]",
"challengeDesc74":"Please offer me advice, Lord Zhao, moving forward. You and I shall ensure His Majesty's safety on his South Tour...",
"challengeDesc75":"[Zhao An thinks little of you, but for his son's sake, Zhao An replies with a simper, “Sure, sure!“]",
"challengeDesc76":"[After you leave, Zhao An heads to jail to speak to his son, “Once this thing quiets down, I will bail you out. But you'll have to stay in here for now, or else the trouble would only escalate.“]",
"challengeDesc77":"[Just in a few days, the imprisonment of Zhao Kang has been the talk of the town. However, no one knows who exactly put the Gold Bucket in jail.]",
"challengeDesc78":"[Due to this year's unsatisfying harvest, Lin Bao the bandit, a powerful enemy of the Imperial Court, can't wait to get his hands on Hangzhou anymore.]",
"challengeDesc79":"Shan Ji's soldiers are well-trained, so Prince Baylor orders him to dispatch his men to Hangzhou, also, train Zhao Kang's soldiers strictly.",
"challengeDesc80":"Thank you for your trust, Your Highness. I won't fail you. I'll secure the South Tour!",
"challengeDesc81":"With Shan Ji's help, we are more confident about His Majesty's safety! The recent travels must have worn you out, please get some rest and we'll talk tomorrow.",
"challengeDesc82":"About Lin Bao",
"challengeDesc83":"Lin Bao had already taken control of Hangzhou, but the city still appears to be peaceful as you walk in.",
"challengeDesc84":"Lin Bao was once a RANK 9 official, but he was exiled to Qianzhou because of his venality and lewdness. He managed to fool the escorting soldiers and escaped to Mount Zhongyi to be a bandit boss.",
"challengeDesc85":"I never thought Lin Bao had an old case on him. We should be careful this time.",
"challengeDesc86":"The next day, Lin Bao rallies Mount Zhongyi bandits to attack Hangzhou.",
"challengeDesc87":"Lin Bao, as lecherous as he always is, leads a bunch of bandits to have fun at Blossom Club.",
"challengeDesc88":"The people work in Blossom Club are scared by these menacing bandits. Everyone is being nervous.",
"challengeDesc89":"[Lin Bao smacks Sister Hua and roars, “I want the girls now! If my boys aren't pleased within two hours, I'll kill you all!“ The hostess is terrified, the waiters also keep quiet.]",
"challengeDesc90":"After having enough fun, Lin Bao and his men walk out the door without paying.",
"challengeDesc91":"After Lin Bao's gone, you suggest the hostess reports the case but she says no and tells you how influential Lin Bao is in Hangzhou government.",
"challengeDesc92":"She insists on not reporting the case. You decide to go back to the post station and wait for Su Qi'er to come back for further discussion.",
"challengeDesc93":"Su Qi'er manages to infiltrate in the fortress when the guards are slacking. In Lin Bao's secret room, he finds out that Lin Bao is still communicating with Hu Tingran till this day.",
"challengeDesc94":"Su Qi'er returns to the post station to share the information with you. You then make plans together.",
"challengeDesc95":"Lin Bao takes his men to surround the post station that you stay in. You step outside to bide time for the incoming the troops of Yangzhou Garrison.",
"challengeDesc96":"You and Lin Bao get into an argument until Lin Bao finds the whole thing strange. He orders his bandits to search the station through. Prince Baylor and Shan Ji come to help stall them as well.",
"challengeDesc97":"Lin Bao leaves with his gang after a fruitless search but he doesn't realize there's one person missing. You get the knocked-out bandit drunk and throw him next to Blossom Club.",
"challengeDesc98":"Freed from the spy, you can finally carry out your investigation in Hangzhou. You come across an old man who's willing to tell you about all the bad things Lin Bao has done.",
"challengeDesc99":"The shopkeeper takes you to his house and tells you what Lin Bao did to his daughter.",
"challengeDesc100":"After hearing the shopkeeper out, you promise him that you'll bring Lin Bao to justice and get his daughter back for him.",
"challengeDesc101":"You go back to the post station to discuss how to arrest Lin Bao with your fellows. But you get interrupted as a guest from Yangzhou walks in.",
"challengeDesc102":"Zhao An comes here to stop you from arresting Lin Bao. He says that Lin Bao has too many men and that you shouldn't take the risk.",
"challengeDesc103":"After interrogating a bandit Su Qi'er captured, you learn that Lin Bao commands nearly three thousand men as hooligans and manipulated youngsters around the area have all come to join him.",
"challengeDesc104":"[Shan Ji says that Yangzhou troops are made of nearly one thousand fierce soldiers but you may suffer a heavy loss if you insist on pressing the attack. You guys should work out a brilliant ruse.]",
"challengeDesc105":"[You learn from a hooligan who came for silks that Lin Bao now covets Zhao Kang the Gold Bucket's wealth in Yangzhou.]",
"challengeDesc106":"[You acquire Lin Bao's whereabouts from the hooligan. Shan Ji sets off to gather his men while you send Su Qi'er to pry for intel.]",
"challengeDesc107":"[Su Qi'er overhears that Lin Bao has decided to raid Zhao's mansion the day after tomorrow, more bandits are on their way to Yangzhou. The large bandit pack is determined to occupy Zhao's mansion.]",
"challengeDesc108":"[Zhao An collapses on to the ground after knowing that his mansion will be raided in three days, begging everyone for help.]",
"challengeDesc109":"[Prince Baylor is infuriated by these outrageous bandits. You try to soothe his anger.]",
"challengeDesc110":"[It's highly risky whether distracting Lin Bao's attention by attacking his base or setting an ambush in Zhao's mansion, you advise that Prince Baylor shouldn't be part of your action.]",
"challengeDesc111":"[You break down the pros and cons to Prince Baylor, he agrees with you and shares his thoughts with you.]",
"challengeDesc112":"[The next morning, you receive Mr. Ji's reply. In his letter, he also suggests you head to Yangzhou. You decide to write a letter to Shan Ji, telling him to join forces with you a few days later.]",
"challengeDesc113":"[You send a carrier pigeon to inform Shan Ji of Yangzhou's current situation and request him to lay low. The letter's out, you and Su Qi'er bid Prince Baylor farewell and get ready to leave Hangzhou.]",
"challengeDesc114":"[Before departure, you go over the troops of Yangzhou Garrison with Prince Baylor and get ready to leave.]",
"challengeDesc115":"[You encounter Lin Bao at Huafu Tavern after leaving Hangzhou. You escape from him after a brief confrontation.]",
"challengeDesc116":"[Thanks to Su Qi'er's help, you break free quietly from the bandits' siege. Later, he reads Shan Ji's reply to you.]",
"challengeDesc117":"[Having lost the bandits, you and Su Qi'er finally set out for Yangzhou.]",
"challengeDesc118":"[A bunch of bandits stops your way before Yangzhou city gate.]",
"challengeDesc119":"[You outsmart the bandits at the gate and manage to enter Zhao's mansion.]",
"challengeDesc120":"[Here, you are thrilled to meet Liu Yong and Ji Xiaolan who have been waiting for you already.]",
"challengeDesc121":"[The three of you discuss how to stall Lin Bao.]",
"challengeDesc122":"[You ask the scout to pass your intention of cooperation on to the Yangzhou Aristocrats.]",
"challengeDesc123":"[As you discuss the plan against Lin Bao while waiting for Yangzhou Aristocrat's reply, Zhao An comes along.]",
"challengeDesc124":"[Worried about his son, Zhao An has hurried to Yangzhou. He says Prince Baylor is fine and tells you which path he took and offers to hold a banquet to ensnare Lin Bao.]",
"challengeDesc125":"[You explain your plan to Zhao An but the moment you mention those silver ingots, Zhao An and the butler prevaricate.]",
"challengeDesc126":"It turns out Zhao An does nothing but composing poems and drawing pictures. Whereas Zhao Kang trusts nobody and keeps money all to himself. So Zhao An has no idea where the silver ingots are.",
"challengeDesc127":"Zhao An doesn't speak his mind for fear that it may further incriminate his son.",
"challengeDesc128":"To ensure the plan goes well, you and Zhao An rehearse how you are going to seize Lin Bao.",
"challengeDesc129":"Lin Bao indeed leads a pack of flagrant bandits. Su Qi'er is indignant. You propose that Zhao An goes to welcome Lin Bao.",
"challengeDesc130":"Zhao An greets Lin Bao with respect. He invites Lin Bao to his family banquet.",
"challengeDesc131":"As Lin Bao arrives at Zhao's mansion, Zhao An presents the silver ingots that he prepared, though reluctantly, to lower down his guard.",
"challengeDesc132":"The gems and jade wares in the backyard work, Lin Bao formally accepts the banquet invitation.",
"challengeDesc133":"You comfort Zhao An and once again confirm the details of your action plan with him.",
"challengeDesc134":"After a meticulous preparation, the banquet dedicated to Lin Bao is finally staged at Zhao's mansion.",
"challengeDesc135":"To completely let down Lin Bao's wariness, Zhao An follows your advice to wine with Lin Bao on the dining table.",
"challengeDesc136":"Following your advice, Zhao An foretastes the food and wine for Lin Bao.",
"challengeDesc137":"The noises that you accidentally make while getting rid of the bandits alarm Lin Bao.",
"challengeDesc138":"You put on a show before Lin Bao as you pretend to be hurt.",
"challengeDesc139":"Lin Bao's disregard for you incenses Su Qi'er. After you calm him down, Shan Ji, who has been long waiting, finally shows himself.",
"challengeDesc140":"Shan Ji really is a powerful reinforcement. You plan to break the bandit squads guarding Zhao's mansion one by one after learning a full picture of their deployment.",
"challengeDesc141":"You break Lin Bao's squads one by one and attempt to siege Zhao's mansion with your own men.",
"challengeDesc142":"Now that Zhao's mansion has been surrounded by Shan Ji's soldiers, here comes the crucial part of your plan—— capturing Lin Bao.",
"challengeDesc143":"Zhao An orders the kitchen to drug the food and wine with sleeping powder.",
"challengeDesc144":"In case the bandits should get suspicious, you add a slight amount of sleeping powder in the food and then put more in the wine.",
"challengeDesc145":"Zhao An proposes toasts to Lin Bao and others to lure them into drinking the drugged wine.",
"challengeDesc146":"The bandits paralyze on to the ground as the sleeping powder starts kicking in.",
"challengeDesc147":"Shan Ji and you lead the troops to surround the banquet hall.",
"challengeDesc148":"Lin Bao tries to escape when he finds himself at a disadvantage.",
"challengeDesc149":"As you purge the remaining rebels in Yangzhou, you report the status quo to Prince Baylor in a letter.",
"challengeDesc150":"Prince Baylor is delighted to hear from you, he promises you that he'll definitely commend you before His Majesty when he returns the capital after the South Tour.",
"challengeDesc151":"[You, “Thank you, Your Highness, for your recognition. Serving a sensible emperor and working with you is a fortune of ours.“]",
"challengeDesc152":"[While you celebrate the easy catch of Lin Bao and his gang, the effect of sleeping powder starts to wear off. A prison break is brewing in secret.]",
"challengeDesc153":"[Lin Bao's bandits are skilled fighters and the local prison is shorthanded, the security of the prison is currently a bit concerning.]",
"challengeDesc154":"[Lin Bao, “Pass on my order, tonight is the night we break free. No way we Mount Zhongyi brothers are going to be locked up in these small cages.]",
"challengeDesc155":"[Around midnight, with a quick signal from Lin Bao, the bandits pick the locks of their cells effortlessly. Prison guards are stabbed to death.]",
"challengeDesc156":"[Due to the residual effect of sleeping powder, the bandits aren't at their best. Lin Bao takes his men back to Mount Zhongyi instead of having their revenge.]",
"challengeDesc157":"[Soldier, “My Lord, we have a problem! Lin Bao and his men have broken loose from the prison!“]",
"challengeDesc158":"[Zhao An panics while Shan Ji stayed collected, he said, “Just as I expected, with that little amount of prison guards, Lin Bao can't be contained.]",
"challengeDesc159":"[Zhao An, “What should we do now? Once Lin Bao is fully recovered, he'll come back for me for sure. I'm done...“]",
"challengeDesc160":"[You, “The South Tour would be endangered if we don't crush Lin Bao for good. He is our top priority at the moment. Any ideas, Prince Baylor?“]",
"challengeDesc161":"[Prince Baylor, “Calm down, everyone! Lin Bao the outlaw was on the loose but now that we've known that Mount Zhongyi is his den, I will rush back to the capital for discussion.“]",
"challengeDesc162":"[Liu Yong, “Your Highness, Would you like to hear my idea? Which you can discuss with the Imperial Court ministers.“]",
"challengeDesc163":"[Prince Baylor, “Mr. Liu, you're one of the best strategists I know. You can be straightforward with me.“]",
"challengeDesc164":"[Liu Yong, “The Northern Huns are invading our territory. While we have enough men to hold the defense, casualties will be inevitable. What do you think if we turn Lin Bao on our side?“]",
"challengeDesc165":"[Prince Baylor, “Mr. Liu, you always take national security into consideration! Why didn't I think of that? I'm setting off to the capital for discussion right now.“]",
"challengeDesc166":"[You, “If the plan works, Lin Bao can be a considerable reinforcement at the frontier. If it fails, with the strong Imperial Army, we can end Lin Bao's atrocity once and for all, Prince Baylor.“]",
"challengeDesc167":"[Shan Ji, “I still have around a thousand men under my command. If you can dispatch another thousand soldiers, Your Highness, I'm sure we can destroy Mount Zhongyi bandits.“]",
"challengeDesc168":"[In order to work out a plan prior to Lin Bao's next operation, Prince Baylor rides back to the capital under Su Qi'er's protection at full speed.]",
"challengeDesc169":"[You, “Shan Ji, we are still unsure when Lin Bao will organize another attack, please deploy more soldiers around Zhao's mansion for the time being.“]",
"challengeDesc170":"[Back in Mount Zhongyi with his men, Lin Bao announces, “How I miss my home! Boys, we were trapped by Zhao An this time, I swear I will avenge our brethrens!“]",
"challengeDesc171":"[Bandit, “How dare Zhao An set our brethrens up! Tomorrow, I'll take our boys to slaughter Zhao family!“]",
"challengeDesc172":"[Lin Bao, “Patience. We had a setback because Zhao's mansion was unexpectedly protected by a thousand soldiers. I will personally take you guys to crush Zhao family after we're fully recovered.“]",
"challengeDesc173":"[In the Imperial Court, the advice Prince Baylor took from Liu Yong receives unanimous consent among the ministers.]",
"challengeDesc174":"[Having reached a consensus with the others, Prince Baylor leads two thousand soldiers back to Yangzhou for a quick end.]",
"challengeDesc175":"[Several days later, Prince Baylor leads his troops to Yangzhou City. After spotting the grand army from the mountain top, the bandit scout hurries back to report what's coming at them to Lin Bao.]",
"challengeDesc176":"[Lin Bao gets on the mountain top to check things out. He is frightened by the embattled Imperial Army. Looks like it's real this time.]",
"challengeDesc177":"[Bandits, “Chief, Mount Zhongyi's probably gonna fall this time for good. Let's flee!“ The entire gang is concerned.]",
"challengeDesc178":"[You, “Wow, you are sure fast, Your Highness. You managed to rally a great army of two thousand men in just a few days! We'll successfully wipe Mount Zhongyi bandits out this time.“]",
"challengeDesc179":"[Prince Baylor, “Ha, our new broom, the number two thousand is far from great. And we have to thank Su Qi'er for safeguarding us on the way!“]",
"challengeDesc180":"[Zhao An, “Great! Now I've got an army protecting my mansion.“]",
"challengeDesc181":"[Prince Baylor, “Look at you! You've met the Imperial Army before. I can't believe you were intimidated by a bunch of bandits because you wanted to keep your properties.“]",
"challengeDesc182":"[Zhao An is suitably ashamed. You and your fellows decide to set off to Mount Zhongyi the very next morning.]",
"challengeDesc183":"[The next day, a formidable army of three thousand soldiers, in which Shan Ji's one thousand men are included, march towards Mount Zhongyi besiege to the mountain.]",
"challengeDesc184":"[Prince Baylor sends you to negotiate with Lin Bao. If he doesn't capitulate, the army will launch the attack.]",
"challengeDesc185":"[Lin Bao and his men witnessed the army's arrival. None of them has seen such a scene before. Some bandits have already fled in terror.]",
"challengeDesc186":"[You climb on the mountain to offer Lin Bao a chance to capitulate, telling them that his gang will be enlisted, he immediately agrees to aid in the northern suppression.]",
"challengeDesc187":"[After Lin Bao surrenders, Yangzhou returns to peace again. The charitable Zhao An distributes grains and coins to every family in town, most of the folks start their own businesses.]",
"challengeDesc188":"[Today is the day the South Tour begins, You, Shan Ji and Feng Yuntian kneel by the riverside to wait for the Emperor's arrival.]",
"challengeDesc189":"[The emperor has heard a lot of your feats from Prince Baylor, he's designated you to be the vanguard, responsible for His Majesty's safety.]",
"challengeDesc190":"[You notice a significant crack on the keel of the imperial ship which scents strangely the small of dynamite. You ask Su Qi'er to get the manufacturing records of the ship for you.]",
"challengeDesc191":"[On his way to fetch the manufacturing records of the ship, Su Qi'er is intercepted by an assassin. At the same time, a huge explosion happens beside the river. The ship is blown to sink.]",
"challengeDesc192":"[Finding the explosion suspicious, you and Su Qi'er go to the shipwreck in search of clues by night.]",
"challengeDesc193":"[There you meet the captain, whose throat gets impaled through by a knife that comes out of nowhere right before he decides to talk after a hard consideration. The lead is dead here.]",
"challengeDesc194":"[You realize the severity of this matter, so you send Su Qi'er to get Shan Ji and Feng Yuntian to aid you in your investigation.]",
"challengeDesc195":"[Feng Yuntian frowns, you conclude that the explosion was targeted at His Majesty's life. It's dreadful to imagine if he was on this ship when it exploded.]",
"challengeDesc196":"[Who's going to benefit the most from the emperor's death? You decide to make this your starting point. Soon, you sense that one of His Majesty's valet eunuchs is rather questionable.]",
"challengeDesc197":"[You make a false claim that you've found the manufacturing records of the ship, in the very evening, you get mugged by a man in black. Shan Ji, waiting in ambush nearby, catches the person later.]",
"challengeDesc198":"[The eunuch is the mugger just as you expected. After a few rounds of torture, before he kills himself by biting his own tongue off, the eunuch spits out “The Prince will come after you“.]",
"challengeDesc199":"[The emperor is very satisfied with the job you've done and promotes you. Dali Temple takes over the case thereafter.]",
"challengeDesc200":"[Everyone in Jiangnan now knows you, a decent official that is patriotic and kind to the people. You step on another stage of your career.]",
"challengeDesc201":"[Your reputation in Jiangnan has attracted the emperor's attention, hence, you are required to rush to the capital to meet His Majesty.]",
"challengeDesc202":"[The whole family is in joy but you find that Yuan Fang is concerned and hesitate in speaking his mind.]",
"challengeDesc203":"[Feeling confused, you ask your friends that came to congratulate you to give you a little bit of privacy and then raise your question to Yuan Fang in the study.]",
"challengeDesc204":"[You, an up and coming official, was assassinated multiple times. This is the emperor's summoning, who knows how hard this journey to the capital can be?]",
"challengeDesc205":"[The next day, after your family pack you stuff, you and Su Qi'er are ready to travel up north. At this time, Yuan Fang comes with several big men.]",
"challengeDesc206":"[It turns out that Yuan Fang keeps feeling concerned about this journey, he's hired some muscle from the convoy agency to protect you.]",
"challengeDesc207":"[You are averse to Yuan Fang's scrupulousness. It's peacetime, the journey can't be dangerous. You refuse the bodyguards and set off with Su Qi'er.]",
"challengeDesc208":"[Yuan Fang is very surprised by your attitude. This night, he invites Liu Yong and Ji Yun over for discussion.]",
"challengeDesc209":"[Liu Yong commends Yuan Fang for his thoughtful consideration. He says, “The political system is full of peril, we'd better tread lightly. However, our lord is now on his way, what should we do?“]",
"challengeDesc210":"[Yuan Fang, Liu Yong and Ji Yun have reached a consensus that Yuan Fang will lead the bodyguards to catch up with you at full speed and protect you in secret.]",
"challengeDesc211":"[Nearly noontime, you've been far away from the city. The sun is searing, you and Su Qi'er stop by an inn for a little bit of rest.]",
"challengeDesc212":"[You hear from the next table that highwaymen often rob merchants on the royal road ahead. Travellers had better stick together.]",
"challengeDesc213":"[You follow the innkeeper's advice and team up with the merchants next table.]",
"challengeDesc214":"[You just travel a few miles on the royal road after leaving the inn, your team, unsurprisingly, encounter a gang of robbers holding hammers.]",
"challengeDesc215":"[Outnumbered by the thugs, Su Qi'er is at a disadvantage. Those bodyguards catch you up in the nick of time. The highwaymen scamper off.]",
"challengeDesc216":"[You aren't aware that the guys work for convoy agency is sent by Yuan Fang to protect you in secret. After thanking them, you continue the journey.]",
"challengeDesc217":"[The next day, when passing through a county, you recognize the guard at the gate, he was one of those robbers. You secretly order Su Qi'er to ask the town hall for reinforcement.]",
"challengeDesc218":"[Unfortunately, the County Governor is one of them as well. Su Qi'er is arrested and put in custody with you.]",
"challengeDesc219":"[In jail, you regret not listening to Yuan Fang's advice of hiring more bodyguards. This is such a fiasco.]",
"challengeDesc220":"[The same night, Yuan Fang rushes to the Shan Ji's camp to tell him that you are in custody.]",
"challengeDesc221":"[Shan Ji, “How dare they detain a government officer!“ He then gathers his trusted bodyguards to rescue you.]",
"challengeDesc222":"[Your identity is disclosed when the soldiers rummage your baggage, which scares the County Governor Liu Laosi half to death.]",
"challengeDesc223":"[The County Governor's consultant advises that he might as well kill you in jail to bury the truth.]",
"challengeDesc224":"[That night, the warden takes you out of the jail to the deathly dinner the County Governor prepared for you.]",
"challengeDesc225":"[Su Qi'er knocks the warden out to get you out but the night-patrol discovers you. There is no way back, you take the waist badge gifted by Baylor out from baggage.]",
"challengeDesc226":"[Bang~Bang~Bang~! Catch them quickly, do not let them run away! In the end, those rampant soldiers encircle you.]",
"challengeDesc227":"[You show them the royal badge, but the County Governor snatches it and throws it onto the ground. He is determined to end your life.]",
"challengeDesc228":"[Liu Laosi, “Catch these two prison breakers. Today is the day you die. Soldiers, execute them right here!“]",
"challengeDesc229":"[You get to survive thanks to Shan Ji's timely rescue. You are surprised when you notice Yuan Fang standing behind Shan Ji.]",
"challengeDesc230":"[Yuan Fang tells you what they did in detail. You regret deeply for the impulsive decision you made.]",
"challengeDesc231":"[Before you say thanks to Shan ji, he proposes that he escorts you to the capital.]",
"challengeDesc232":"[The crisis has been resolved, you and your fellows get back on track.]",
"challengeDesc233":"[Ten days later, you arrive in the capital and check into Yuelai Inn. The owner warmly welcomes you.]",
"challengeDesc234":"[Being told that you are summoned by the emperor, the innkeeper takes out his smoking pipe and sits down for a long conversation with you.]",
"challengeDesc235":"[Recently, people keep talking about a virtuous and decent officer in Jiangnan who secured the South Tour and brought bad guys to justice. Are you him, the reputable officer?]",
"challengeDesc236":"[You didn't expect that your feats in Jiangnan would be spread to the capital. You stand up to make a gesture and say, “He's overrated but that person is me.“]",
"challengeDesc237":"[After confirming your identity, the innkeeper flatters you and excuses himself from the conversation in a hurry.]",
"challengeDesc238":"[Su Qi'er speaks your mind, “How come a insignificant innkeeper knows about your arrival? It's rather dodgy.“]",
"challengeDesc239":"[Your concern proves to be true. At midnight, Shan Ji gets into the room over a window to inform you that a group of men in black has surrounded the inn.]",
"challengeDesc240":"[At the critical moment, Prince Baylor takes his men to the rescue. Su Qi'er, badly injured, is carried to the medic.]",
"challengeDesc241":"[Prince Baylor was going to invite you to his mansion, however, he'd been busy. If his scout didn't report your dangerous situation to him, he would have forgotten your arrival.]",
"challengeDesc242":"[You get confused about what happened early tonight, so you ask Prince Baylor who would want you dead in the capital.]",
"challengeDesc243":"[Do you remember Zhao Kang who was sent to jail by you? His father, Zhao An, is favored by His Majesty. Zhao An can't forgive you for arresting his son, he must be the man behind this assassination.]",
"challengeDesc244":"[You realize that you've become an eye-sore to many people in the capital, some of them will take the opportunity to retaliate.]",
"challengeDesc245":"[You bow to Prince Baylor and say, “Prince Baylor, thank you very much for coming to save me tonight. If it wasn't for your timely rescue, I would have been dead.“]",
"challengeDesc246":"[You take your belongings to move into Prince Baylor's mansion. You are secured and Su Qi'er gets to receive better treatment.]",
"challengeDesc247":"[Three days later, Eunuch Wang that serves Prince Baylor comes with the Imperial Edict, you are summoned to the Imperial Palace.]",
"challengeDesc248":"[You spruce yourself up after receiving the edict and follow Eunuch Wang to the Imperial Palace. Meanwhile, Su Qi'er and Yuan Fang begin to pack stuff to get ready to go home after you come back.]",
"challengeDesc249":"[You soon arrive at Taihe Gate. As you wait outside, Eunuch Wang goes in to turn in the Imperial Edict. After a while, you hear waves of yells from inside the hall, “By His Majesty's edict...“]",
"challengeDesc250":"[Nudged by Prince Baylor, you walk on the Path of Rank that ministers walk every day. You reach the entrance of the Majestic Hall in no time.]",
"challengeDesc251":"[It turns out today is the Hearing Day, every capital official with a rank is waiting to be called outside the hall.]",
"challengeDesc252":"[Because your rank is low, you have to wait at the back of the queue. But now the emperor orders, “The one who was summoned, step forward and come in.“]",
"challengeDesc253":"[His Majesty praises you for fighting evils in Jiangnan and cracking the ship explosion case.]",
"challengeDesc254":"[The emperor gives a sign by glancing at Eunuch Li Yougui, who then holds the Imperial Edict with both hands and announces loudly, “By the Imperial Edict, His Majesty orders...“]",
"challengeDesc255":"[You bow and stand down after the emperor promoted you in the Majestic Hall. On your way back to Baylor's mansion, everything still feels like a dream.]",
"challengeDesc256":"[Back in Baylor's mansion, you order Yuan Fang to put your luggage down. You have now become a capital official, so you'll be living in the capital from now on.]",
"challengeDesc257":"[Yuan Fang still doesn't have the foggiest about your promotion. After a brief silence, he asks with shaking body, “My lord, what’s your new position?“]",
"challengeDesc258":"[The news of you being promoted to RANK 18 flies back to your house in Jiangnan. Xiaolian asks the menials to pack things up for a family relocation.]",
"challengeDesc259":"[Yuan Fang and Su Qi'er have been busy picking servants and mansion guards these days. The mansion granted by His Majesty is almost cleaned up.]",
"challengeDesc260":"[Prince Baylor becomes a regular guest of your new mansion. He often comes to discuss national affairs with you in spare time.]",
"challengeDesc261":"[Recently, the Southern Barbarians have been actively harassing the border. The pro-and anti-war factions argue in the hall every day.]",
"challengeDesc262":"[Pro-war faction is basically made of ambitious youths while the anti-war mostly elder ministers. The resultless quarrel has been going on for three days.]",
"challengeDesc263":"[You've sumbitted your proposition with your mates many times, but the conservatives hold you down every time. Today, you go to Baylor's mansion for discussion yet coincidentally, you meet...]",
"challengeDesc264":"[You meet Lord Wucheng in Baylor's mansion, a great lord who lives up to his reputation. He should be the best man for submitting the proposition.]",
"challengeDesc265":"[In Baylor's mansion, you and Lord Wucheng reach a consensus on suppressing the Barbarian King. Wucheng will initiate the campaign to assemble progressives nationwide to win the argument.]",
"challengeDesc266":"[In the Majestic Hall, Lord Wucheng beats all the objectors in the argument. The emperor calls you to the Imperial Study before noon after the morning assembly is over.]",
"challengeDesc267":"[The emperor takes your advice of declaring a war on the Southern Barbarians. He appoints Lord Wucheng to be the general, you and Baylor deputy generals. You will march down south after three days.]",
"challengeDesc268":"[This night, you entrust your entire family to Yuan Fang. You request him to look after your harem.]",
"challengeDesc269":"[Feng Xiaolian, “My lord, please take me with you. You'll need a girl to look after you in the army.]",
"challengeDesc270":"[You hold Xiaolian in your arms and sigh, “No. Taking a girl to a war is against the rules. But don't worry, I will be back in six months or maybe even less, three months.]",
"challengeDesc271":"[Feng Xiaolian looks up at you and says, “My lord, you must take care of yourself. We will be waiting for your triumphal return at home.]",
"challengeDesc272":"[Three days later, the day for departure, Lord Wucheng, all in white, leads the march with you and Prince Baylor by both sides as you march all the way to the south.]",
"challengeDesc273":"[Lord Wucheng leads the army as the vanguard with you and Baylor on both flanks. The long march heads to south in peace until day 7...]",
"challengeDesc274":"[A scout comes back to report to you that a group of barbarians is on the move thirty miles ahead. You immediately go to the Command Center to share the intel with Lord Wucheng.]",
"challengeDesc275":"[The Southern Barbarians' rapid march surprises Lord Wucheng. But after thinking it over, he finds it questionable so he orders you to take one of your troops to check it out.]",
"challengeDesc276":"[You go check the village thirty miles ahead with a hundred riders, there you discover those are not barbarians but a group of bandits in disguise.]",
"challengeDesc277":"[You order your riders in anger to attack the false barbarian army and capture their chief alive. Your troop obeys as they gallop down from the hill straight to the village.]",
"challengeDesc278":"[The bandits scuttle away when they see the Imperial Riders charging at them but there's no way feet can outrun four-legged steeds. In a flash, the bandit gang gets disassembled.]",
"challengeDesc279":"[You question the chief that is captured alive about where their costumes came from and he comes clean. You've now learned that the barbarians have stationed in a town ahead.]",
"challengeDesc280":"[A messenger rides back to the Command Center with this information under your order while you go to the town to pry into this barbarian cantonments.]",
"challengeDesc281":"[It's true, the serried barbarian tents verify the bandit chief's word. Judging from a distance, this is a vanguard cantonment of the barbarians.]",
"challengeDesc282":"[According to the stove pits and the footprints, the vanguard force is nearly 30,000 people. They camp under a hill which is an ideal spot to hold the defense.]",
"challengeDesc283":"[You head straight into the Command Center when you are back in your bastion and draw up a plan with Lord Wucheng, who has been waiting for you with Prince Baylor for a long time.]",
"challengeDesc284":"[The day is dry and the forest is dense, since the enemy's cantonments are under a hill, you come up with the ruse of fire.]",
"challengeDesc285":"[Your suggestion is well-acknowledged. Lord Wucheng is even more delighted. It's a blessing that a managerial and tactical talent like you is loyal to the country.]",
"challengeDesc286":"[After the discussion, you rally the troops to prepare for the upcoming battle. You will be the acting commander of the spearhead force.]",
"challengeDesc287":"[The barbarian cantonments are surrounded by a dense forest. In a dry day like this, you set them on fire in an instant after you order to rain tens of thousands of fire arrows on them.]",
"challengeDesc288":"[In an attempt to escape, the barbarian captains gather the residual soldiers to break through your encirclement but your soldiers set them all back. Wails and howls echo in the valley.]",
"challengeDesc289":"[You return to your bastion with a triumph. The barbarian vanguard force is annihilated, their main forces move back 300 miles in fear.]",
"challengeDesc290":"[Your feat widely spreads over the whole nation. Your soldiers esteem you, an all-round commander who masters both governing and military skills, even more.]",
"challengeDesc291":"[Lord Wucheng advises before the emperor, “We refuse to make peace with the Southern Barbarians. We shall march south to kick them back to their barren land once and for all.“]",
"challengeDesc292":"[The emperor thinks highly of you, more soldiers are integrated into your army from the capital. Marching southward, you continue going after the Southern Barbarian remnants.]",
"challengeDesc293":"[The war has been going on for two years. In this time, not only the lost lands are retrieved, but the southern border has been largely expanded. The war intimidates the Southern Barbarians more.]",
"challengeDesc294":"[Back to the capital, you stand once again in the Majestic Hall. The emperor entitles you as Duke Wucheng, ranked under Lord Wucheng. Your job is to assist him with national and military affairs.]",
"challengeDesc295":"[Back to your mansion, Xiaolian and her sister, Yuan Fang and the rest have lined up to welcome you home.]",
"challengeDesc296":"[“My lord, finally, you are home.“ Stricken with lovesickness, Xiaolian cries and plunges into your arms.]",
"challengeDesc297":"[You hug Xiaolian tight and walk into the mansion slowly while looking at the close ones of yours.]",
"challengeDesc298":"[That night, a great banquet is held, and the mansion is bustling with excitement. Shan Ji, Feng Yuntian and other friends come together to meet with you.]",
"challengeDesc299":"[The next morning, a herald from the Imperial Palace informs you that Lord Wucheng is sick severely. You are called into the palace.]",
"challengeDesc300":"[Year 26 of Datong Calendar, Lord Wucheng dies of illness. His Majesty bestows the title Lord Wucheng on you.]",
"challengeDesc301":"[After the morning assembly, you come across the late Lord Wucheng's Heir. You express your condolences.]",
"challengeDesc302":"[You readily agree to the Heir's invite to his house, however, he excuses himself with family business from your brief chat.]",
"challengeDesc303":"[Back to the mansion, you change into a casual clothing and intend to go there on your own.]",
"challengeDesc304":"[Su Qi'er has been waiting outside the mansion with a group of guards. Now that you are Lord Wucheng, an important figure in the political system, you must be well-proteced.]",
"challengeDesc305":"[On your way to the Heir's mansion, Su Qi'er notices people surveilling you surreptitiously.]",
"challengeDesc306":"[Su Qi'er tries to seize one of them but the man fades into the crowd.]",
"challengeDesc307":"[After you arrive at your destination, Su Qi'er knocks the door open.]",
"challengeDesc308":"[House bleak, retainers scarce, Lord Wucheng's mansion has lost its old day glamour since he passed away]",
"challengeDesc309":"[You follow the butler to meet with the Heir in the parlor. Seated down, you tell what happened on your way here to him.]",
"challengeDesc310":"[Through the Heir's explanation, you learn that the street isn't staking you but the Heir's mansion out, which is the former Lord Wucheng's mansion.]",
"challengeDesc311":"[The Heir sends his bodyguards away, he gets close to tell you in private that he's aware of those surveillants.]",
"challengeDesc312":"[You are shocked, “Who dares to surveille a lord's mansion in the capital?“]",
"challengeDesc313":"[The Heir seats himself next to you and utters who's behind the surveillance. It's the emperor himself.]",
"challengeDesc314":"[His father was too successful. Incited by backstabbers, the emperor intended to poison his father to death out of malice.]",
"challengeDesc315":"[The late Lord Wucheng skipped morning assemblies using his sickness as an excuse after knowing he was in danger. However, the mansion was compromised, he was poisoned to death without knowing it.]",
"challengeDesc316":"[Before he died, he wanted you to know that the political system is arduous. Also, he enjoined you to maintain integrity but beware of the haters lurk in the dark at the same time.]",
"challengeDesc317":"[You sigh inside, “Lord Wucheng devoted himself to the nation and the people but ended up with a tragic death.“]",
"challengeDesc318":"[After bidding the Heir farewell, you come back to your mansion. Inisde the study alone, you feel so uncertain about your career.]",
"challengeDesc319":"[At the morning assembly next day, message from the frontline says the Southern Barbarian is plotting an invasion. The emperor orders you to take 50,000 soldiers to defend the border as the general.]",
"challengeDesc320":"[You accept the Token of Authority and head straight to the barrack to rally the troops after the morning assembly.]",
"challengeDesc321":"[Head to the barrack outside the capital in a carriage, you see a man wearing violet gold python robe standing on the high platform of the barrack from a distance.]",
"challengeDesc322":"[The man is Lord Zhennan. Having heard you are going to march south, he came here to wine and dine your troops. Apparently, he's here with other purposes, so you invite him in.]",
"challengeDesc323":"[In the tent, you sit face to face with him. This is the first time you lead an army as a general, you have so much to learn from Lord Zhennan about the captain selection.]",
"challengeDesc324":"[While you and Lord Zhennan are on the subject, Chief Eunuch Zhang arrives and halts before the barrack with the Imperial Edict.]",
"challengeDesc325":"[His Majesty orders you to set off tomorrow. Such an urgent edict misgives you. (The Southern Barbarians are not on a major operation, why must you leave the capital in a hurry?)]",
"challengeDesc326":"[What further confuses you is that Chief Eunuch Zhao drives Lord Zhennan away from your conversation, saying he's wanted by the emperor. How come the emperor knows he's here?]",
"challengeDesc327":"[After dealing with the barrack, you return to prepare for the crusade. On your way back home, Lord Zhennan's butler stops your carriage to hand you a letter and leaves in haste.]",
"challengeDesc328":"[Back in the carriage, you open the envelope. It's Lord Zhennan himself's handwriting, “It will be a long journey, beware of the haters in the Court.“]",
"challengeDesc329":"[Back to the mansion, you throw the letter into the fire and have Yuan Fang call Shan Ji and Feng Yuntian here for discussion.]",
"challengeDesc330":"[You share what the letter said with Shan Ji and Feng Yuntian, telling them you are on someone's death list. You request them to observe the Imperial Court and send you letters if necessary.]",
"challengeDesc331":"[The next day, before the army sets out, the emperor sees you off in person.]",
"challengeDesc332":"[The situation is looking bad, news from the frontline says the barbarians have broken through the border and are commiting a holocaust on our territory.]",
"challengeDesc333":"[Two Imperial Edicts in a day, you are urged to reinforce the border at full speed. Desperately, you have to order 5,000 cavalrymen to reinforce the frontline first.]",
"challengeDesc334":"[Frontline news says the barbarians scamper off once they know you are commanding the army.]",
"challengeDesc335":"[Knowing the Barbarian King is a cunning warlord, you send cavalrymen to fake a pursuit in the daytime while urging the defensive line construction by night.]",
"challengeDesc336":"[Just as you predicted, scout comes back at night with the news of the barbarians closing in. They are now in the southeast forest.]",
"challengeDesc337":"[You've seen them coming. You ask the soldiers to bury flammable stuff like hay and kerosene under dry leaves. One conflagration will be as powerful as 100,000 soldiers.]",
"challengeDesc338":"[At midnight, barbarians in the southeast forest are ready to attack. You order to set the woods on fire. In an instant, all you hear are screams and howls.]",
"challengeDesc339":"[You make a clean sweep. Not only the barbarians were utterly wiped out, their king has also been captured alive. The border returns to peace ever since yet you feel somehow insecure.]",
"challengeDesc340":"[Five days later, on your way back to the capital, an Imperial Edict orders the army to station at a nearby town for now but you shall be debriefed alone in the capital.]",
"challengeDesc341":"[Later, still on your way back to the capital, you get a letter from Lord Zhennan's carrier pigeon, which says, “The emperor has been confined, beware the trap in the citadel!“]",
"challengeDesc342":"[You give a secret order that the army will take a bypass near the town to approach the capital while you continue heading back to the capital on your own.]",
"challengeDesc343":"[Lord Zhennan, surprisingly, has been waiting for you outisde the city gate with his guards. You meet and greet, he then explains the mutiny to you in detail.]",
"challengeDesc344":"[The barbarian invasion was a conspiracy initiated by the Firstborn Prince, who tried to exterminate you together with the Barbarian King. But beyond his expectations, you got the better of his ally.]",
"challengeDesc345":"[During your way back to the capital, the Firstborn Prince held the emperor hostage in order to manipulate all the lords. Luckily, Lord Zhennan escaped before things went down.]",
"challengeDesc346":"[The capital garrison has to obey the Firstborn Prince's order as His Majesty was held hostage, you cannot press the internecine attack.]",
"challengeDesc347":"[Liu Yong advises that you pretend to siege the citadel in the evening while your best men get the emperor out on the sly. Thus, the capital garrison will change side to fight against the mutineers.]",
"challengeDesc348":"[Around midnight, your army makes battlecries outside the south gate. The Firstborn Prince climbs on the wall with the eunuchs' help, claiming that he's here to safeguard the throne.]",
"challengeDesc349":"[While the duplicitous prince is making his great speech, you take your finest men to infiltrate into the Imperial Palace through the north gate. Guards there drop their weapons when they see you.]",
"challengeDesc350":"[With the convoy of north gate guards, you arrive at the Imperial Palace without a hitch, meanwhile, most of the guards are at the south gate, the palace is defenseless.]",
"challengeDesc351":"[You order Su Qi'er to climb over the wall. He takes the gatekeepers down inside the palace and opens the gate.]",
"challengeDesc352":"[The fire at the south gate unsettles you, you ask Su Qi'er to check it out.]",
"challengeDesc353":"[The Majestic Hall seems exceptionally creepy in the shades of the conflagration. Sword held tightly in hand, you push the gate open.]",
"challengeDesc354":"[Inside the hall, you find a trembling eunuch. He is Eunuch Li, one of the emperor's valets.]",
"challengeDesc355":"[From what he's told you, you learn that the Firstborn Prince has taken the emperor out of the capital to somewhere else, you feel things a bit off.]",
"challengeDesc356":"[As soon as you walk out of the Majestic Hall, you see Su Qi'er rushing over from a distance.]",
"challengeDesc357":"[He says the Firstborn Prince has seen through your trick, he's now coming at the Imperial Palace with a small group of soldiers.]",
"challengeDesc358":"[Battlecries come from the south gate, your guards are fighting with the mutineers already.]",
"challengeDesc359":"[You order your team to retreat from the north gate but a bunch of assassins gets in your way.]",
"challengeDesc360":"[However, none of them are match for Su Qi'er. Soon, he knocks them all down.]",
"challengeDesc361":"[You remove one assassin's mask and recognize that he's an eunuch. You speculate that it may be a long-premeditated conspiracy.]",
"challengeDesc362":"[Pressed for time, you retreat from the north gate in a hurry with one eunuch under Su Qi'er control.]",
"challengeDesc363":"[Outside the city, you meet Lord Zhennan and tell him that you don't know where His Majesty is.]",
"challengeDesc364":"[In desperation, Lord Zhennan wants to break into the Imperial Palace to rescue the emperor right away.]",
"challengeDesc365":"[You stop Lord Zhennan and specify the pros and cons. And there you hear the wails of the eunuch, “Please! I'll tell!“]",
"challengeDesc366":"[Shan Ji's cruel torture squeezes every word of His Majesty’s location from the eunuch.]",
"challengeDesc367":"[Apparently, the Firstborn Prince invited the emperor to his mansion for opera shows, that's how the confinement happened.]",
"challengeDesc368":"[The Firstborn Prince's mansion is intensely garrisoned. You need to work out a brilliant plan.]",
"challengeDesc369":"[In the middle of your discussion on your rescue plan, Lord Zhennan signals you with his eyes.]",
"challengeDesc370":"[There's a shadow eavesdropping your conversation at the southeast outside the tent. With an idea in mind, you hint Lord Zhannan that you'd better keep talking.]",
"challengeDesc371":"[You stealthily order Su Qi'er to keep close watch on the eavesdropper and then get back to the false rescue plan with Lord Zhennan.]",
"challengeDesc372":"[You and Lord Zhennan have made a “deal“ that tomorrow midnight, you will attack the south gate again and today, you will boost morale with wine and food.]",
"challengeDesc373":"[Once your false rescue plan is made, the shadow disappears. You order Su Qi'er to tail the eavesdropper.]",
"challengeDesc374":"[Su Qi'er dives into the bushes and follows the guy's trail closely.]",
"challengeDesc375":"[Su Qi'er later comes back to report to you that the scout who works for the Firstborn Prince, as you expected, heads straight to his master's mansion in the city.]",
"challengeDesc376":"[Around dawn, scout reports that the Firstborn Prince is leading a number of elite riders towards your camp.]",
"challengeDesc377":"[You figured that the Firstborn Prince will raid you when your troops are drunk but you have set the traps in advance.]",
"challengeDesc378":"[Your ruse catches him off guard. The elite riders fall into the traps and the Firstborn Prince himself is surrounded.]",
"challengeDesc379":"[Humiliated and enraged, the Firstborn Prince breaks through the ring of encirclement with the help of his residual riders. You order to chase him.]",
"challengeDesc380":"[As the Firstborn Prince rides off, you pray, “Brother, I'm counting on you.“]",
"challengeDesc381":"[When you scavenge the battlefield, a galloping wagon draws your attention on the royal road in the distance.]",
"challengeDesc382":"[It's His Majesty sitting inside the wagon. While soldiers cheer and hurray, you are planning for the next move in mind.]",
"challengeDesc383":"[The Firstborn Prince freaks out when he knows that His Majesty has been evacuated. Whereas you are pressing the preparation for counterattack.]",
"challengeDesc384":"[His Majesty approves of your plan and personally hands you the Token of Authority.]",
"challengeDesc385":"[Three days later, troops from all over the nation join yours in the capital. Tomorrow, you will attack the citadel.]",
"challengeDesc386":"[The next day, Su Qi'er reports to you that, surprisingly, the capital garrison has opened the gate to welcome His Majesty back while the Firstborn Prince is nowhere to be found.]",
"challengeDesc387":"[Shan Ji takes the vanguard force to pry into the citadel. When everything's checked, he convoys His Majesty back to the Imperial Palace.]",
"challengeDesc388":"[Three groups of elite riders of yours go on the lookout for the Firstborn Prince northward, eastward, and southward respectively.]",
"challengeDesc389":"[The Firstborn Prince is caught at Ten-mile Temple outside the city and escorted back to the capital by Shan Ji.]",
"challengeDesc390":"[This evening, Shan Ji comes to talk to you in your mansion. It turns out that he encountered assassins on their back, but they didn't try to rescue the prince but to murder him!]",
"challengeDesc391":"[“Is there a larger case behind the mutiny?“ You thought, “They were trying to erase the evidence!“]",
"challengeDesc392":"[The next morning, an eunuch brings the Imperial Edict upon you. After ordering Su Qu'er to keep close watch over the mutineers, you head to the Imperial Palace.]",
"challengeDesc393":"[His Majesty highly praises your rescue operation. You receive a dukedom and a higher title, as well as the congratulations from all the ministers.]",
"challengeDesc394":"[Just being rewarded by day, you are surprised to see His Majesty come to visit you in a casual outift in the evening.]",
"challengeDesc395":"[You learn that the mutiny arose from the emperor's favoritism for the Third Prince. There are so many people related to this case that if there were a trial, half of the Court would be convicted.]",
"challengeDesc396":"[You suddenly realize that the rulership is built up by all those ministers. If it weren't for them, His Majesty would be nothing but a vain title.]",
"challengeDesc397":"[Now that the emperor has decided to put this mutiny behind him, you resign from you job as the Grand Judicator of this case.]",
"challengeDesc398":"[The next day, noon, Prince Baylor comes to visit you. You understand now that the Firstborn Prince has been deposed, the game of the heirship will soon ensue.]",
"challengeDesc399":"[After seeing Prince Baylor off, you call Liu Yong and Ji Xiaolang to explain Prince Baylor's purpose.]",
"challengeDesc400":"[The two scholars give you some advice through which you grow a new perspective on the nation and rulership.]",

"challengeStoryDesc1":"How dare you tyrannize innocent civilians in a nation that respects the law?",
"challengeStoryDesc2":"Hey, boys, do you hear that? Here comes a lowlife lecturing us about the law, hahaha!",
"challengeStoryDesc3":"Hey, here's a tip from us, Lord Zhao's word is the law here! Even if the First Talent's here, we'll still arrest them! Soldiers, take down this couple that committed adultery and bring them to Lord Zhao!",
"challengeStoryDesc4":"Yes",
"challengeStoryDesc5":"Outrageous! The first day on my job, here I meet such a lawless gang, so is your master!",
"challengeStoryDesc6":"[Eyeballing the cloth gown on you, the soldiers don't believe that you are an official, they keep disrespecting you just the same.]",
"challengeStoryDesc7":"Soldier, “Hum! How dare you, a scholar, call yourself an official. Boys, we've got a big case day, this guy disregards the Imperial Court. Take him back, Lord Zhao will reward us generously!“",
"challengeStoryDesc8":"[At this time, a group of people is coming over on the street. You gaze at them, it's your butler Yuan Fang leading several gentlemen here to aid you] Su Qi'er, “Move aside, you jackals! Don't you touch my master!“",
"challengeStoryDesc9":"[Finding you are surrounded by those soldiers, Su Qi'er dashes over to protect you. Out of the sheath, his sword is against their leader's neck in an instant.]",
"challengeStoryDesc10":"[You feel relieved as you see Yuan Fang and others are here to control the situation.]",
"challengeStoryDesc11":"[You turn around to ask the girl if she's fine.]",
"challengeStoryDesc12":"[Thank you for helping me, my lord.] The girl curtsies to you.",
"challengeStoryDesc13":"[You get to know more things about Zhao Hu, son of Zhao Qun, a lewdster who drew the girl's husband away three days in an attempt to rape her but failed. Annoyed by frustration, he tried to frame her up.]",
"challengeStoryDesc14":"[Before she finishes, the girl cries once again.] Her husband went to argue with him but they beat him so hard that he cannot even get off the bed.",
"challengeStoryDesc15":"[The evil official has been pulling rank in the city for years. Hadn't he imposed heavy taxes on the folks back then, your father wouldn't die illness because you didn't enough money to get a doctor.]",

"challengeStoryDesc17":"[Fists clenched, you swear inside, “I will bring this maggot to justice for my father and the folks.“]",

"challengeStoryDesc19":"Yes, my lord!",
"challengeStoryDesc20":"[on your way back home, Yuan Fang is still concerned about what happened earlier.] My lord, I'm afraid Zhao Qun will try to get even with us.",
"challengeStoryDesc21":"[You are fully aware of it. You two have become enemies today, next, a life-and-death clash will follow.]",
"challengeStoryDesc22":"Salaried by the Imperial Court, Zhao Qun (Censor, RANK 1) harms the welfare of the folks instead.",
"challengeStoryDesc23":"With Zhao Qun's indulgence, his wretched son Zhao Hu (Warden, RANK 1) has been molesting girls and bullying folks for years. It's time for them to meet their punishments.",

"challengeStoryDesc25":"Who are you?",
"challengeStoryDesc26":"Away from hometown for long, you have forgotten the local rules, huh? My master Zhao Qun is still waiting for your visit. I suggest you show up at our mansion tomorrow, or your job will become more difficult than you expected!",
"challengeStoryDesc27":"That scum, huh?",
"challengeStoryDesc28":"Well, well, well, aren't you a dying man with a foul mouth!",
"challengeStoryDesc29":"Boys, let's go!",
"challengeStoryDesc30":"[After making rounds in town, you return home to discuss with your fellows about how to deal with Zhan Qun.]",
"challengeStoryDesc31":"The two Zhaos, one is the servant of money, another is the slave of lust. They are indeed two hideous pests.",
"challengeStoryDesc32":"I heard that Zhao Hu killed one of our neighbors, Mrs. Zhang's daughter not long ago. To exculpate his son, Zhao Qun imputed the murder to Liu Sixi.",
"challengeStoryDesc33":"[You are more determined to bring Zhao Qun down once hearing such scandal.]",
"challengeStoryDesc34":"We must make it quick. The two maggots mustn't get a chance to escape.",
"challengeStoryDesc35":"Su Qi'er, set an ambush around Zhao's mansion tomorrow in advance. We shall arrest together.",
"challengeStoryDesc36":"I, Su Qi'er, guarantee that I will bring the villains to justice for you!",
"challengeStoryDesc37":"[While you are in discussion, you hear a woman crying for help outside the house.]",
"challengeStoryDesc38":"Sir, what are you doing? Please, no! Help!",
"challengeStoryDesc39":"[You rush out to see what's going on.]",
"challengeStoryDesc40":"Hey, bastard, how dare you break the law in front of an officer's house?",
"challengeStoryDesc41":"[You jump in the way between the two of them.]",
"challengeStoryDesc42":"I do whatever I want on my territory! You bold insects, don't you know who I am? I'm Zhao Hu! And do you know who my father is?",
"challengeStoryDesc43":"[The name Zhao Hu astonishes you] Can't believe it happens so fast, he's here to ask for imprisonment himself.",
"challengeStoryDesc44":"Zhao Hu, over the years, you've been doing evil stuff. Do you admit your crimes? I'm going to arrest you today to soothe the restless souls of the deaths in your hand.",
"challengeStoryDesc45":"Guys, take this pest down for me!",
"challengeStoryDesc46":"I dare you!",
"challengeStoryDesc47":"Scum, you walk around every day, breaking the laws while being salaried by the Imperial Court. I, Su Qi'er, shall punish you for the common good!",
"challengeStoryDesc48":"You... You... How dare you touch me!",
"challengeStoryDesc49":"[As a new broom, you are still unsure of the consequences of arresting Zhao Hu.]",
"challengeStoryDesc50":"[Ji Xiaolan sees through your troubled face and says,] Zhao Hu is in jail right now, I'm sure Zhao Qun will make plans against us.",
"challengeStoryDesc51":"Here's my plan. Tomorrow, Su Qi'er sneaks into Zhao's mansion pretending to be one of Zhao's guards and we shall capture from both sides...",
"challengeStoryDesc52":"[The next day, you arrive at Zhao Qun's mansion and deploy your men around the building.]",
"challengeStoryDesc53":"[Zhao Qun's servant sees you coming and asks their men to wait in ambush.]",
"challengeStoryDesc54":"So this is Zhao's mansion, I'm here to...",
"challengeStoryDesc55":"Yeah, yeah, yeah, cut the crap. I know who you are. Come on in!",
"challengeStoryDesc56":"[Once you enter the house to the front yard, you have a feeling that something is off.]",
"challengeStoryDesc57":"Oh, you've got our new broom in the house. I thought you wouldn't dare to be here, ha!",
"challengeStoryDesc58":"[Zhao Qun looks around as if he's searching for something.]",
"challengeStoryDesc59":"Yesterday was your first day on the job, yet I hear that you arrested my men and even my son!",
"challengeStoryDesc60":"Why can't I see my son here with you? Are you keeping him in jail?",
"challengeStoryDesc61":"Zhao Qun, you evil bastard, many innocent people incriminated by you and your son are in jail over the years. Today, on behalf of the Imperial Court and the locals, I will arrest you!",
"challengeStoryDesc62":"[Up to this point, Su Qi'er has knocked out all the guards waiting in ambush in the backyard, he's on his way to aid you.]",
"challengeStoryDesc63":"You are in my front yard already, don't you dream of leaving here alive today. Soldiers, take him down!",
"challengeStoryDesc64":"[The soldiers waited in the front yard jump out but there's nothing going on in the backyard.]",
"challengeStoryDesc65":"Hum, do you think I would come unprepared? Ha, what a joke!",
"challengeStoryDesc66":"Guys, take this scum wretched maggot back to my mansion.",
"challengeStoryDesc67":"[Your men break into the house after hearing your order.]",
"challengeStoryDesc68":"Clever boy, a worthy opponent. Let's see who will make the last stand. My fine soldiers or your rabble?",
"challengeStoryDesc69":"[Su Qi'er arrives and removes his disguise at this moment.]",
"challengeStoryDesc70":"My lord, sorry for coming late. The backyard of Zhao's mansion has been cleared. Now is the time for a full-attack.",
"challengeStoryDesc71":"Zhao Qun, you maggot, today is the day you die!",
"challengeStoryDesc72":"[After Zhao Qun's arrested, you go to visit the folks locked up in Zhao's dungeons and hope that their testimonies can be used to charge against Zhao Qun.]",
"challengeStoryDesc73":"[The number Liu Yong gives you shocks you, there were more than one hundred people locked up in the cells.]",
"challengeStoryDesc74":"[You help an old man stand up and ask,] For what crime did Zhao Qun put you in jail?",
"challengeStoryDesc75":"[The old man wipes his tears away and says, ] Thank you for saving me. I used to own a shop on the street, people called me Tailor Zhang. I had a daughter with a pretty face, Zhao Qun laid eyes on her...",
"challengeStoryDesc76":"[The old man starts crying again.] My daughter refuses to be taken by the Zhaos, Zhao Hu then took her to jail and... and tortured her to death.",
"challengeStoryDesc77":"I wanted to go to the capital to sue them but Zhao Qun heard my plan. His men put me in this cell three months ago.",
"challengeStoryDesc78":"[The flagitious Zhao Qun has killed many innocent people. He must be convicted this time.]",
"challengeStoryDesc79":"Mr. Su, please take these folks to the doctor.",
"challengeStoryDesc80":"Yes, my lord!",
"challengeStoryDesc81":"You can go back to the mansion, my lord. I'll handle the rest.",
"challengeStoryDesc82":"Thank you!",
"challengeStoryDesc83":"[Late at night, you walk out of your study after a long day.]",
"challengeStoryDesc84":"[Looking at the stars in the sky, you miss your parents.] Dad, mom! I've ranked first in the Imperial Examination, which is a great honor! Can you... see me from heaven?",
"challengeStoryDesc85":"[On the roof, a bunch of men in black is watching you in silence.]",
"challengeStoryDesc86":"Who's there?",
"challengeStoryDesc87":"[A dart hits the gate pillar from one of them and then they all disappear into the dark.]",
"challengeStoryDesc88":"[When Su Qi'er runs out of the mansion, they're already long gone.]",
"challengeStoryDesc89":"[You open the envelope fixed on the gate pillar by the dart, it says, “Mind your own business, or else you will die!“]",
"challengeStoryDesc90":"My lord, the Zhaos have backers in the Court. You'd better tread lightly from now on!",
"challengeStoryDesc91":"My job is to benefit the people. I fear nothing!",
"challengeStoryDesc92":"Yes, for the sake of the people, I will safeguard the mansion with my life!",
"challengeStoryDesc93":"[During your jurisdiction, the town suffers from drought, as well as a storm of locusts...]",
"challengeStoryDesc94":"My lord, someone's drumming outside.",
"challengeStoryDesc95":"Come on, open the office.",
"challengeStoryDesc96":"[There are a bunch of ragged, frustrated peasants outside the house, their leader, an elder man steps forward.] My lord, have mercy on us. The crops are ruined by locusts, a year's hard work is wasted. Please, we need help.",
"challengeStoryDesc97":"My lord, the drought is the main cause of the locust plague.",
"challengeStoryDesc98":"Indeed. Are there any anti-pest specialists in town?",
"challengeStoryDesc99":"Tang Bohu at the Academy may be able to help.",
"challengeStoryDesc100":"Okay, everyone, worry not, I will report the natural disasters to the Imperial Court and apply for relief supplies. I will visit Tang Bohu in person tomorrow.",
"challengeStoryDesc101":"[After you and Liu Yong work out a letter to request the Court for relief supplies, you order Su Qi'er to take it to the capital at full speed.]",
"challengeStoryDesc102":"Yes, my lord, I'll on my way right now!",
"challengeStoryDesc103":"[The next day, you and your fellows visit Tang Bohu At the academy.]",
"challengeStoryDesc104":"Mr. Tang, regarding the current locust plague, could you advise?",
"challengeStoryDesc105":"My lord, the crops have been completely ruined. I'm afraid it's already too late at this point. But...",
"challengeStoryDesc106":"But what? Tell us!",
"challengeStoryDesc107":"But if we cut off what the locusts live on, we'll see great harvests in the following year.",
"challengeStoryDesc108":"I see. So how do we cut off those locusts' food sources?",
"challengeStoryDesc109":"Locust feeds on corn, wheat, sorghum, rice and millet. Please order the peasants to burn the farmlands, then the next year's great harvests will be guaranteed.",
"challengeStoryDesc110":"My family and I will get the pesticide ready for the next year for our folks.",
"challengeStoryDesc111":"Thank you, Mr. Tang. My report is on its way to the Imperial Court. The relief supplies from the authority will help our folks get through the year.",
"challengeStoryDesc112":"[Liu Gen (County Mayor, RANK 2) hears that you have applied for relief supplies, he schemes for making them his own.]",
"challengeStoryDesc113":"Butler, send our men to hold the county entrance. Once the relief supplies arrive, swap them with duds and bring them back to our granary.",
"challengeStoryDesc114":"Yes, Sir!",
"challengeStoryDesc115":"[Back in your mansion, you gather the folks to handle the locusts in accordance with Tang Bohu's instruction.]",
"challengeStoryDesc116":"[Peasant, “Milord, we've got nothing to eat. What are we supposed to do?]",
"challengeStoryDesc117":"Folks, don't worry. I have reported our predicament to the Imperial Court, soon, the relief supplies will be distributed to everyone. Just be patient for the moment.",
"challengeStoryDesc118":"[On the other side of the town, Liu Gen's (County Mayor, RANK 2) men are already there waiting to snatch the grains as soon as the carts arrive.]",
"challengeStoryDesc119":"Boys, stay vigilant! We will take every single sack away and slay every single escort!",
"challengeStoryDesc120":"Look alive! Do a good job tonight and we'll feast!",
"challengeStoryDesc121":"[Soon, Qu Su'er convoys the relief supply carts to the gate.]",
"challengeStoryDesc122":"Charge, my brothers! Kill them all!",
"challengeStoryDesc123":"Bastards, how dare you rob the food for starving folks?",
"challengeStoryDesc124":"Folks? Ha, I bet you are going to keep them for yourself! Boys, get him!",
"challengeStoryDesc125":"As a public servant appointed by the Imperial Court, you want to make the relief food for the people your own? Over my dead body!",
"challengeStoryDesc126":"[Outnumbered by the well-prepared enemy in this fight, Su Qi'er, even though badly wounded, still swears to guard the food with his life.]",
"challengeStoryDesc127":"Charge, soldiers! [At this point, Yuan Fang and your soldiers come to the rescue in time.]",
"challengeStoryDesc128":"[Things aren't looking good, Liu Gen yells,] Retreat, everyone, let's go!",
"challengeStoryDesc129":"Protect our master! Retreat, now!",
"challengeStoryDesc130":"None shall escape! [With the last bit of energy, Su Qi'er pounces at Liu Gen and pins him on the ground.]",
"challengeStoryDesc131":"Boys, tie them up! Leave no one behind!",
"challengeStoryDesc132":"[Thanks to you, the combat had a turnaround. Yuan Fang came to aid Su Qi'er because you were concerned about the relief food delivery.]",
"challengeStoryDesc133":"Mr. Su, many thanks to you! hey, get the best doctor in town here!",
"challengeStoryDesc134":"It would be my honor to die for you, my lord!",
"challengeStoryDesc135":"I can't believe those highwaymen tried to rob the food for the people.",
"challengeStoryDesc136":"Actually, Liu Gen used to be a bandit before he got a rank. His uncle Qian De (Vanguard Captain, RANK 3) is a man with military power. None of the local low-ranking officers dare to act against him.",
"challengeStoryDesc137":"My lord, Mr. Su is now badly injured, as a new broom, you have no ally in the Imperial Court. I suggest that you reach out to those with military powers sooner rather than later.",
"challengeStoryDesc138":"You are correct, Mr. Ji!",
"challengeStoryDesc139":"[While you are in conversation, you suddenly recall that you have something urgent needs to be done.]",
"challengeStoryDesc140":"Oh, I almost forgot that we need to distribute the relief supplies to the folks. Yuan Fang, gather them, now.",
"challengeStoryDesc141":"Yes, my lord, I'm on it!",
"challengeStoryDesc142":"[The good news assembles the folks at your mansion gate, everyone's eager to get their ration.]",
"challengeStoryDesc143":"[The folks want to visit Mr. Su who got injured for the public welfare after hearing the story.]",
"challengeStoryDesc144":"Don't you worry, everyone, I will convey your concerns and gratitude to Mr. Su but now he needs to recover in peace. Please go home once you get your ration.",
"challengeStoryDesc145":"[The anti-locust battle and relief supply convoy have portrayed you as a virtuous and people-caring official to the locals. The townsfolk highly esteem ever since.]",
"challengeStoryDesc146":"[At this moment, Shan Ji (Cavalry Captain, RANK 3) is observing you from afar.]",
"challengeStoryDesc147":"This man has a promising future. I must share what he has done with Lord Feng Yuntian (County Governor, RANK 4).",
"challengeStoryDesc148":"[Meanwhile, you are also under Qian De's secret surveillance.]",
"challengeStoryDesc149":"[The next day, you order Yuan Fang to post a recruitment notification in a bid to seek some good fighters.]",
"challengeStoryDesc150":"[After a full day of interviews, you still can't find anyone more suitable for the job than Su Qi'er.]",
"challengeStoryDesc151":"[All of a sudden, an assassin in black stands in your way and asks,] Stop there! Are you the new First Talent?",
"challengeStoryDesc152":"How dare you make an attempt on my life?",
"challengeStoryDesc153":"I just take the money and do the job. Die!",
"challengeStoryDesc154":"Who wants me dead?",
"challengeStoryDesc155":"Never you mind that!",
"challengeStoryDesc156":"[The folks gather around to watch the incident after hearing a commotion.]",
"challengeStoryDesc157":"[Shan Ji has foreseen that you may already be someone's death list.]",
"challengeStoryDesc158":"Want him dead? Ask me first!",
"challengeStoryDesc159":"[Fight's over, Shan Ji subdues the assassin.]",
"challengeStoryDesc160":"Say it. Who is behind?",
"challengeStoryDesc161":"I'd rather die than tell you! [The assassin ends his own life by biting the tongue off.]",
"challengeStoryDesc162":"Doesn't look like a mercenary to me!",
"challengeStoryDesc163":"[Your arm was accidentally sliced open just now. The cut is quite deep.]",
"challengeStoryDesc164":"Thank you for your help, hero. What's your name?",
"challengeStoryDesc165":"A brave man you are indeed. You didn't panic during the assault. I am right about you!",
"challengeStoryDesc166":"My name is Shan Ji, the local Cavalry Captain...",
"challengeStoryDesc167":"[before he finishes talking, you pass out.]",
"challengeStoryDesc168":"[You wake up again finding yourself in the bed at home.]",
"challengeStoryDesc169":"[Not until you open your eyes, does everyone feel relieved.]",
"challengeStoryDesc170":"My master, finally, you are awake! You were in a coma for 3 days! I was so worried!",
"challengeStoryDesc171":"What? 3 days?",
"challengeStoryDesc172":"That night, one of the neighbors, Pan carried you back home. What on earth happened?",
"challengeStoryDesc173":"I was assaulted on my way back home that night. I can remember a man in black saved my life.",
"challengeStoryDesc174":"Shan Ji?",
"challengeStoryDesc175":"Yes, yes, him!",
"challengeStoryDesc176":"You kept mumbling the name during your coma!",
"challengeStoryDesc177":"Yuan Fang, get Sir Shan's address for me, I must go there to thank him in person.",
"challengeStoryDesc178":"How's Mr. Su doing right now?",
"challengeStoryDesc179":"Su Qi'er walks into the room and says, “My lord, I'm all good now. Thank you for your concern.“",
"challengeStoryDesc180":"[The next day, Yuan Fang manages to locate Shan Ji's mansion.]",
"challengeStoryDesc181":"Take me to the lifesaver of mine right now.",
"challengeStoryDesc182":"[You and your fellows arrive at the Cavalry Captain's mansion.]",
"challengeStoryDesc183":"Who goes there?",
"challengeStoryDesc184":"I'm the new broom of the town, the new First Talent in the Imperial Examination. If it weren't for your master, Sir Shan, I would have been dead. I'm here to express my gratitude.",
"challengeStoryDesc185":"What First Talent? Never heard of you before. My master went to County Mayor Feng's mansion three days ago. He's not home yet. shoo!",
"challengeStoryDesc186":"[The butler shut you out. The fellowship is disappointed.]",
"challengeStoryDesc187":"When will your master come home? I'll visit him again, then!",
"challengeStoryDesc188":"How am I supposed to know his schedule? Cross your fingers next time.",
"challengeStoryDesc189":"[Shan Ji is gone to visit Feng Yuntian in the county days ago.]",
"challengeStoryDesc190":"Greetings, Lord Shan, allow me to notify your arrival.",
"challengeStoryDesc191":"Thanks.",
"challengeStoryDesc192":"Shan Ji? It's been a while since he last came. Come on, invite him in!",
"challengeStoryDesc193":"Yes! Please come in, Lord Shan.",
"challengeStoryDesc194":"Lord Feng, long time no see. I'm here to discuss something with you today.",
"challengeStoryDesc195":"Sure, we are old acquittances. Just speak your mind!",
"challengeStoryDesc196":"Not long ago, the First Talent of this year's Imperial Examination was assigned to Shaxian County. It's a blessing for the county to have a decent, incorruptible, people-oriented official like him.",
"challengeStoryDesc197":"I've been observing him in secret for a while. He recently got into trouble as he arrested Liu Gen, whose uncle Qian De, I'm sure, will come after our new broom soon.",
"challengeStoryDesc198":"[As soon as they meet, Shan Ji tells Lord Feng about what happened.]",
"challengeStoryDesc199":"Qian De? Isn't he your supervisor?",
"challengeStoryDesc200":"Exactly! That's why I'm here to seek your help.",
"challengeStoryDesc201":"Although my position is the Cavalry Captain, I'm already sick of working under Qian De (Vanguard Captain, RANK 3), that scheming, villainous man.",
"challengeStoryDesc202":"You maintain your integrity even though you are under a bad leader. For that, I will support you.",
"challengeStoryDesc203":"[Lord Feng agrees to Shan Ji's request for helping you in secret.]",
"challengeStoryDesc204":"What's your next move, then?",
"challengeStoryDesc205":"I'm sure Qian De will try to bail his nephew out soon. That will be when our new First Talent meets a problem.",
"challengeStoryDesc206":"Listen, you head back to safeguard him in secret. When Qian De's on the move, you send a carrier pigeon to me with a letter, I will rush to you as soon as possible!",
"challengeStoryDesc207":"Very thoughtful of you, Lord Feng!",
"challengeStoryDesc208":"Remember my word, be extra careful, stay cool and do not act recklessly.",
"challengeStoryDesc209":"Thank you for your admonishment. See you, my lord!",
"challengeStoryDesc210":"So soon? You're only here for a while.",
"challengeStoryDesc211":"Qian De might get suspicious of me because I went AWOL. So see you around.",
"challengeStoryDesc212":"[Shan Ji says goodbye to Lord Feng and rides back to Shaxian County at full speed.]",
"challengeStoryDesc213":"Welcome back, Lord Shan. When you are away, a guy called himself the First Talent came to ask about you every day.",
"challengeStoryDesc214":"Oh, is that so?",
"challengeStoryDesc215":"Yes. The man said he wanted to thank you for saving his life.",
"challengeStoryDesc216":"A grateful man indeed.",
"challengeStoryDesc217":"Sir Shan, you're finally back in town.",
"challengeStoryDesc218":"Oh, our new First Talent.",
"challengeStoryDesc219":"I'd been in a coma for three days since the incident that night. After I woke up, I've been meaning to meet you, at last, my waiting pays off.",
"challengeStoryDesc220":"Mr. Su, come forward with the present.",
"challengeStoryDesc221":"[While you waited for Shan Ji's return, you asked the skillful Blacksmith Li to forge a premium sword with the best materials.]",
"challengeStoryDesc222":"Sir Shan, I cannot be more thankful for my lifesaver. Please accept the humble gift as a token of my gratitude.",
"challengeStoryDesc223":"[Shan Ji, an enthusiast for swords, accepts your gift with pleasure.]",
"challengeStoryDesc224":"A great sword indeed. I appreciate it.",
"challengeStoryDesc225":"[Sir Shan looks around vigilantly and whispers,] Come in and have a conversation with me.",
"challengeStoryDesc226":"Butler, please shut the gates. Do not allow anyone inside.",
"challengeStoryDesc227":"You put Liu Gen in jail, his uncle Qian De will come and demand you to release his nephew. I bet that assassin the other night worked for Qian De.",
"challengeStoryDesc228":"I'm a man of righteousness. All I care about is public welfare. Intimidation or browbeating won't scare me.",
"challengeStoryDesc229":"[Su Qi'er bows to you and apologizes,] Due to my remissness, I failed to protect you. Punish me by the rules!",
"challengeStoryDesc230":"[You help him up.] You were injured during the relief supplies delivery. It wasn't your fault!",
"challengeStoryDesc231":"Thank you for saving my lord, Sir Shan. If anything happened to him, my existence in the world would be a disgrace.",
"challengeStoryDesc232":"Mr. Su, you are a faithful man indeed. You should consider following an honorable master a fortune whereas I...",
"challengeStoryDesc233":"Sir Shan, do continue...",
"challengeStoryDesc234":"To be frank, Qian De the local Vanguard Captain is my boss. Although I can't stand his misdeeds, my hands are tied really!",
"challengeStoryDesc235":"[Everyone's shocked.]",
"challengeStoryDesc236":"Now that Qian De's nephew is in your prison, I'm sure he and his men will come and knock on your door soon.",
"challengeStoryDesc237":"In the past few days, I went to seek Lord Feng Yuntian's help in the county. However, as powerful and efficient as he can be, he is still miles away from us. You still need to be extra careful.",
"challengeStoryDesc238":"[Learning that Shan Ji has been running around for your safety, overflowing feeling of gratitude fills your heart.]",
"challengeStoryDesc239":"We'd never met before, yet you kept watching over me in secret and saved my life. I can't thank you enough.",
"challengeStoryDesc240":"Since you took up the position, I have been observing you from a distance. You've proven to be a man of righteousness, which is scarce these days.",
"challengeStoryDesc241":"As we live by the same code and I'm indebted to you, why don't we become sworn brothers to share all the good and the bad from now on?",
"challengeStoryDesc242":"Great! a kindred spirit is serendipity. From now on, we shall stick together through thick and thin.",
"challengeStoryDesc243":"[There the great alliance between you and Shan Ji begins.]",
"challengeStoryDesc244":"Although you and I are now sworn brothers, Li Sihai is still in power. In case he gets skeptical, we should avoid meeting each other too often. My butler will be the messager between our mansions.",
"challengeStoryDesc245":"You are right, Brother Shan. We'd better meet as little as possible in case you get in trouble.",
"challengeStoryDesc246":"[Qian De's mother's birthday is coming, he sent someone to your mansion with an invitation.]",
"challengeStoryDesc247":"Here's the invitation. You must show up at our madam's birthday banquet.",
"challengeStoryDesc248":"You take the invitation and have a look. It's from Qian De!",
"challengeStoryDesc249":"Our master demands you to be there. We expect to see your face. Any other questions?",
"challengeStoryDesc250":"I know the handwriting, it is from Qian De. Looks like you must be at this banquet, my lord.",
"challengeStoryDesc251":"Knowing that his nephew is in your prison, Qian De still invites you over. He must have something up his sleeve.",
"challengeStoryDesc252":"Mr. Ji is right. You must handle the situation with deliberation.",
"challengeStoryDesc253":"We should hear Shan Ji's thoughts.",
"challengeStoryDesc254":"[As soon as you finish talking, Shan Ji comes in from the backdoor.]",
"challengeStoryDesc255":"You must have received the invitation from Qian De, right?",
"challengeStoryDesc256":"Wow, you reacted rapidly, Brother Shan. We've just got it.",
"challengeStoryDesc257":"Believe me, it's a death trap. We must be fully prepared. I'm setting off to the county to meet with Lord Feng now.",
"challengeStoryDesc258":"Wait!",
"challengeStoryDesc259":"I have an idea with which we can take Qian De down at the banquet.",
"challengeStoryDesc260":"Whoa, it's very adventurous of you to capture Qian De in his own house. Such unprecedented logic!",
"challengeStoryDesc261":"[You've figured out how to convict Qian De. However, your position is lower than him, you aren't qualified to arrest him.]",
"challengeStoryDesc262":"Please invite Lord Feng over, Brother Shan. With him around, our operation will succeed!",
"challengeStoryDesc263":"Oh, I also need another favor from you, Brother Shan.",
"challengeStoryDesc264":"You have easy access to the Vanguard Captain's office. On the day before the banquet, get someone sneak some official silver ingots into Qian De's vault.",
"challengeStoryDesc265":"So you want to impute the blame to Qian De. Cunning you.",
"challengeStoryDesc266":"It's not imputation. It's just giving him a taste of his own medicine.",
"challengeStoryDesc267":"[Once Shan Jin understands your plan, he sets off to the county hall to invite Feng Yuntian.]",
"challengeStoryDesc268":"[Meanwhile, Qian De and his sworn brother Zhang Cheng (Chiliarch, RANK 3) are scheming how to end your life on your way to the banquet.]",
"challengeStoryDesc269":"You should be careful during your journey for it'll take you more than one day to reach Qian De's mansion.",
"challengeStoryDesc270":"The route is threatened by rampant bandits, you'd better take a couple of more soldiers with you.",
"challengeStoryDesc271":"My lord, I'm so worried about you, let me go with you.",
"challengeStoryDesc272":"No, it'll be a precarious journey, you just stay home and take care of the sister. If anything happens to me...",
"challengeStoryDesc273":"Shush, you mustn't say that! You will return home safe and sound.",
"challengeStoryDesc274":"Mr, Su, take care of my dear for me, please.",
"challengeStoryDesc275":"[Time is short, Shan Ji rushes all the way to Lord Feng's mansion nonstopping.]",
"challengeStoryDesc276":"[*Knock knock knock*, *Bang Bang Bang* Open up! Open the door!]",
"challengeStoryDesc277":"Who is disturbing our master in the middle of the night? What horrible manners!",
"challengeStoryDesc278":"[The butler opens the door.] Oh, it's Shan Ji. What's up? Why are you in a rush?",
"challengeStoryDesc279":"[Feng Yuntian walks out of his chamber with a coat on his shoulders.]",
"challengeStoryDesc280":"Lord Feng, Qian De is on the move!",
"challengeStoryDesc281":"Wow, so fast!",
"challengeStoryDesc282":"Qian De's mother's 80th birthday celebration will be held the day after tomorrow. Our new broom has been invited to the banquet...",
"challengeStoryDesc283":"He's an ingenious fellow indeed. He wanted to arrest Qian De at the banquet. The plan is almost ready except one part is missing, you, Lord Feng! Come with me to convict Qian De.",
"challengeStoryDesc284":"[Lord Feng calls you a daring man after hearing Shan Ji out.]",
"challengeStoryDesc285":"Butler, fetch the authoritative seal His Majesty granted me. We'll lend the official silver ingots in the vault to Shan Ji for a few days.",
"challengeStoryDesc286":"All right, no time to waste. Let's go!",
"challengeStoryDesc287":"I'll be on my way to transfer the silver ingots.",
"challengeStoryDesc288":"[You set off to the banquet as soon as the sun rises.]",
"challengeStoryDesc289":"Be careful, my lord. Mr. Su, please watch over my lord and the others!",
"challengeStoryDesc290":"Of course. I won't let anyone touch him.",
"challengeStoryDesc291":"[It's been a long day, you pass by the only inn along the way at twilight.]",
"challengeStoryDesc292":"My lord, the inn feels a bit off. The attendants all seem menacing. We'd better be careful.",
"challengeStoryDesc293":"Isn't this our new First Talent? Are you heading to Lord Qian's mansion as well?",
"challengeStoryDesc294":"[You speak to the innkeeper regardless of Zhang Cheng.] Tea, please.",
"challengeStoryDesc295":"[Zhang Cheng cuts in,] Hey, you, do you hear the First Talent? He wants tea!",
"challengeStoryDesc296":"My lord, what's the deal here? It seems Zhang Cheng has been waiting for you.",
"challengeStoryDesc297":"Here comes your tea!",
"challengeStoryDesc298":"Wait, let me test it.",
"challengeStoryDesc299":"[Liu Yon dips a silver needle into the tea, in an instant, the needle tip turns black.]",
"challengeStoryDesc300":"How dare you poison the tea!",
"challengeStoryDesc301":"[Zhang Cheng and his gang show their true colors as they whip out the weapons after the disclosure.]",
"challengeStoryDesc302":"So you want the hard way. Boys, kill them all!",
"challengeStoryDesc303":"[Zhang Chen's men are no match for Su Qi'er, soon, you capture the chiliarch.]",
"challengeStoryDesc304":"[The next day, you arrive at the Vanguard Captain's mansion. Qian De's butler is stupefied to see you walking over.]",
"challengeStoryDesc305":"[So far, Shan Ji has smuggled the silver ingots into Qian De's vault.]",
"challengeStoryDesc306":"Here comes our new First Talent. How kind of you to have traveled so far to attend my mother's humble birthday party!",
"challengeStoryDesc307":"Lord Chen, it's my pleasure! It's an excellent chance to take my men out on a field trip!",
"challengeStoryDesc308":"[An unpleasant look appears on Qian De's face. He then turns to welcome other guests.]",
"challengeStoryDesc309":"[The banquet begins. Acting clueless, Qian De asks a superfluous question,] Where is my nephew Liu Gen?",
"challengeStoryDesc310":"[Knowing Qian De is provoking you on purpose, you utter the truth without scruple,] Not long ago, I put Liu Gen in custody because he attempted to rob the relief supplies from the Imperial Court.",
"challengeStoryDesc311":"My nephew has always been a good boy, he can't commit such a crime. I say you made up the story.",
"challengeStoryDesc312":"[Seeing you are all alone by yourself, Qian De stirs up other officials' opinions to join him in demanding you to release Liu Gen.]",
"challengeStoryDesc313":"[At this point, Feng Yuntian breaks in the venue and says,] I happen to be traveling through the place, but figured I should drop by since you people are being so loud.",
"challengeStoryDesc314":"The locals are having a hard time while you lot are having an extravagant birthday banquet. Where do you get your money from? Soldiers, check the vault!",
"challengeStoryDesc315":"[Everything goes as planned, you find a huge amount of official silver ingots in the vault. Qian De, too, is dumbfounded.]",
"challengeStoryDesc316":"My lord, I'm innocent! It's a frame-up!",
"challengeStoryDesc317":"[Qian De has been put into prison, the locals rejoice and hurray with beaming faces.]",
"challengeStoryDesc318":"So you are the new broom I've heard a lot of? Here I finally meet with you, a genius with guts. Shan Ji really has a pair of sharp eyes.",
"challengeStoryDesc319":"You've overrated me, Lord Feng, I couldn't have arrested Qian De without you. If it wasn't for your timely aid, I would probably be in prison right now instead of Qian De.",
"challengeStoryDesc320":"Hahaha, how humble of you! We both work for the Imperial Court, it's for the common good.",
"challengeStoryDesc321":"Thank you for traveling so far to aid us. I, Shan Ji, no longer need to work under a dirtbag against my will.",
"challengeStoryDesc322":"Brother Shan, it only took you three days to ride to and from the county! Such unique efficiency!",
"challengeStoryDesc323":"I'm a newcomer in town. It's a great honor of mine to have you two lords on my side.",
"challengeStoryDesc324":"How about the three of us join hands to strive for the welfare of our people? What do you say?",
"challengeStoryDesc325":"We are thinking the same. Lord Feng, what about you?",
"challengeStoryDesc326":"It's a blessing to make acquaintance with you two in the chaotic world. Declining to work with you equals refusing to defend our people!",
"challengeStoryDesc327":"[Thus, you, Shan Ji and Feng Yuntian become allies and sworn brothers. From now on, you share all the pain and happiness with each other in your careers.]",
"challengeStoryDesc328":"[The civilians esteem Shan Ji's integrity despite the fact that he used to work under the villain Qian De, who has been put in jail right now.]",
"challengeStoryDesc329":"[Soon, Shan Ji gets promoted to be the Imperial Guard Commander.]",
"challengeStoryDesc330":"[After you hear his promotion, you go to congratulate Shan Ji in person.]",
"challengeStoryDesc331":"Sir Shan, I'm here to give you my wholehearted congratulations.",
"challengeStoryDesc332":"Ha, bro, quit the formality with me.",
"challengeStoryDesc333":"Our alliance finally attains military power. It's worth a celebration.",
"challengeStoryDesc334":"[Recently, several rich families' ancestral graves were robbed one after another. Many burial treasures have been stolen.]",
"challengeStoryDesc335":"The Imperial Court has ordered me to investigate the recent grave robberies. I will dig out who's behind it as soon as possible.",
"challengeStoryDesc336":"Seriously? Steal from the dead? Don't they fear for karma?",
"challengeStoryDesc337":"These grave robbers seem to be quite familiar with every grave. They are able to strip a simple-structured grave overnight.",
"challengeStoryDesc338":"Such hideous immorality! Any ideas, brother?",
"challengeStoryDesc339":"I shall seek the Minister of Etiquette's knowledge tomorrow. Perhaps he can offer instructions!",
"challengeStoryDesc340":"Just tell me how I can help!",
"challengeStoryDesc341":"[The next day, you set off to learn from Zheng De (Minister of Etiquette, RANK 5).]",
"challengeStoryDesc342":"Who are you? What do you want?",
"challengeStoryDesc343":"I'm a new local officer, I'd like to have a chat with the Minister of Etiquette.",
"challengeStoryDesc344":"Oh, a new local officer, huh? Explain to me what you are here for. My master doesn't do casual talks with guests.",
"challengeStoryDesc345":"Very condescending of your master!",
"challengeStoryDesc346":"Su Qi'er, behave yourself!",
"challengeStoryDesc347":"I am on the grave robbery case under the Imperial Court's order. I'm here to seek Minister of Etiquette's help!",
"challengeStoryDesc348":"[The butler's expression changes dramatically but soon he regains composure.]",
"challengeStoryDesc349":"It's no news for us. However, it isn't my master's field. Go on! Shoo!",
"challengeStoryDesc350":"[The butler shuts the door in a hurry.]",
"challengeStoryDesc351":"If this isn't the Minister of Etiquette's department, then what is? How can he call himself a public servant?",
"challengeStoryDesc352":"The butler acted strangely, this matter seems questionable judging from the look on his face.",
"challengeStoryDesc353":"I got the same feeling!",
"challengeStoryDesc354":"[The minister's butler panicked, so you order Su Qi'er to tail and watch Zheng De on the sneak.]",
"challengeStoryDesc355":"[You shout to them outside the house.] Tell your master that I'll visit him again.",
"challengeStoryDesc356":"[After confirming that you've left through the crevice between two doors, the butler scuttles back to the study to inform Zheng De.]",
"challengeStoryDesc357":"My lord, my lord, bad news!",
"challengeStoryDesc358":"Quiet! What made you so nervous?",
"challengeStoryDesc359":"My lord, we are in trouble. Someone is in charge of the investigation of the grave robberies under the Imperial Court's order.",
"challengeStoryDesc360":"Pull yourself together, why would I fear him? He's but a minor local officer!",
"challengeStoryDesc361":"From my observation, this guy has got an imposing charisma, he won't be an easy opponent!",
"challengeStoryDesc362":"Well, I'd like to meet this man. Invite him in, then.",
"challengeStoryDesc363":"I just chucked him away...",
"challengeStoryDesc364":"Tch, brainless flunky! Why didn't you ask for my instruction? You only made us look guilty!",
"challengeStoryDesc365":"I...",
"challengeStoryDesc366":"That lord said he would visit you again some other day!",
"challengeStoryDesc367":"Servants, put the jade wares away...",
"challengeStoryDesc368":"[Unbeknownst to them, Su Qi'er is furtively watching Zheng De's servants running back and forth in the garden.]",
"challengeStoryDesc369":"My lord, after you left, the Minister of Etiquette's mansion was busy moving things around. From my experience, I'd say those were jade wares in their hands.",
"challengeStoryDesc370":"Is that so?",
"challengeStoryDesc371":"Yes, and the quantity is large!",
"challengeStoryDesc372":"How is it possible for a local Minister of Etiquette to own so many jade wares. That doesn't sound normal.",
"challengeStoryDesc373":"Maybe...",
"challengeStoryDesc374":"[When you go to visit Zheng De the next day, his butler becomes much politer.]",
"challengeStoryDesc375":"Oh, my dear lord. Apologies, but my master was sick in bed yesterday, he wasn't in the best shape to see a guest.",
"challengeStoryDesc376":"Please have a seat in the lounge. I'll notify my master now.",
"challengeStoryDesc377":"[Later, you finally meet with Zheng De (Minister of Etiquette, RANK 5)",
"challengeStoryDesc378":"*Cough cough* My apologies, sir, I should have come out to usher you in myself.",
"challengeStoryDesc379":"It's fine, I'm sorry for disturbing you while you are sick. Please forgive me, Lord Wu.",
"challengeStoryDesc380":"I'm on the grave robbery case under the Imperial Court's order and I'm here consult you, Lord Wu.",
"challengeStoryDesc381":"Grave robbery is a common occurrence here. The prevention measures can never keep up with the robbers.",
"challengeStoryDesc382":"I understand you are a new broom who's eager to make a difference but you'll get used to it eventually.",
"challengeStoryDesc383":"[Zheng De's dereliction astonishes you.]",
"challengeStoryDesc384":"Lord Zheng, are you averse to bothers?",
"challengeStoryDesc385":"How dare you insult my master? Who do you think you are?",
"challengeStoryDesc386":"Silence! It's not your place to speak. Out, out! Let me talk with this kind sir alone.",
"challengeStoryDesc387":"[After driving his servants away, Zheng De does something astounding.]",
"challengeStoryDesc388":"[Zhang De takes out a piece of jade ware to you and says,] Here, take this. As long as you promise me to drop the case, I guarantee you an affluent life even if you stand around and do nothing at all.",
"challengeStoryDesc389":"[You are dumbfounded by Zheng De's behavior. You start to suspect his motives, but you choose to play along for now.]",
"challengeStoryDesc390":"It's inappropriate for a junior to receive a welcoming gift from a senior. I apologize for my lack of manners. I really should have brought something today.",
"challengeStoryDesc391":"Forget about the formality. We are family from today on. If I make money, you make money.",
"challengeStoryDesc392":"[You decide to take the jade ware for now.]",
"challengeStoryDesc393":"[Back to your mansion, you hastily call Su Qi'er to get Feng Yuntian and Shan Ji here to identify the jade ware.]",
"challengeStoryDesc394":"[Feng Yuntian recognizes the item at first sight.] Isn't this one of General Wen Zhang's burial treasures? Where did you get it?",
"challengeStoryDesc395":"[You explain from whom you got it to the two lords.]",
"challengeStoryDesc396":"I went to visit Zheng De, the Minister of Etiquette the other day, his butler acted weirdly after knowing what I was there for. And you know what? Zheng De personally gave me this jade ware today. So I suspect that...",
"challengeStoryDesc397":"My lord, would you like to hear my idea? It might sound devious though...",
"challengeStoryDesc398":"Spit it out!",
"challengeStoryDesc399":"We can get someone to construct a fake grave where we hold a fake but grand funeral. This may be a way to lure the culprit out of the shadows.",
"challengeStoryDesc400":"What a brilliant idea! I've got clever people around me.",
"challengeStoryDesc401":"[You are told that there's a merchant in town known for his enthusiasm for jade. You head to his residence.]",
"challengeStoryDesc402":"[You specify the plan to the merchant. He's happy to pretend to die for you.]",
"challengeStoryDesc403":"Now the biggest problem is where to find someone to construct a grave.",
"challengeStoryDesc404":"It's not that hard. Just leave it to me!",
"challengeStoryDesc405":"[The next day, Yuan Fang finds you a grave constructor. You request him to engineer a trap inside the crypt.]",
"challengeStoryDesc406":"[Grave constructor, “I will do my best, my lord.“]",
"challengeStoryDesc407":"Please keep the construction of the grave a secret, everyone, in case we alert the criminals.",
"challengeStoryDesc408":"I'll send several confidential soldiers to help you with the construction so as to speed the process up.",
"challengeStoryDesc409":"Thank you, Brother Shan. We must hurry. The sooner we arrest the culprit, the fewer grave robberies there will be.",
"challengeStoryDesc410":"[After three days of secret construction, the grave is finally complete.]",
"challengeStoryDesc411":"[The step two in your plan is to spread the news of the salt merchant's death.]",
"challengeStoryDesc412":"[The next day, you head to Zheng De's mansion to spill the beans.]",
"challengeStoryDesc413":"Lord Zheng, are you getting well?",
"challengeStoryDesc414":"*Cough cough* Thank you for visiting me, my bro. I'm much better now.",
"challengeStoryDesc415":"Lord Zheng, watch your health condition. I tell you what, that salt merchant in town, he died recently because he pushed himself too hard when he was alive. You don't wanna follow him to heaven.",
"challengeStoryDesc416":"[Zheng De's eyes sparkle as he hears the news.]",
"challengeStoryDesc417":"Are you talking about the salt merchant who was a jade enthusiast?",
"challengeStoryDesc418":"Yeah, did you know him?",
"challengeStoryDesc419":"[Zheng De quells the excitement on his face and denies,] No, no, no. I didn't know him, I only knew of him.",
"challengeStoryDesc420":"[Zheng De, too, is a jade enthusiast. He knows that the merchant had a collection of quite a number of premium jade wares, which he's been coveting for years.]",
"challengeStoryDesc421":"[Zheng De starts plotting in mind the moment he hears the salt merchant's death.]",
"challengeStoryDesc422":"I heard the salt merchant had a collection of many precious treasures. I imagine the burial stuff for his funeral would be plenty.",
"challengeStoryDesc423":"[Zheng De once again forces himself to act normal.]",
"challengeStoryDesc424":"[“Oh, is that so?“ He says indifferently.]",
"challengeStoryDesc425":"[Now that the bait has been dropped, you think it's time to leave.]",
"challengeStoryDesc426":"Lord Zheng, you aren't fully recovered yet. Take care of yourself, I'm off then.",
"challengeStoryDesc427":"[When you are gone, Zheng De calls his butler to collect intel about that merchant's grave.]",
"challengeStoryDesc428":"Yes, my lord, I'm on it!",
"challengeStoryDesc429":"[Soon, the butler comes back panting,] Hoo, my lord, the salt merchant will be buried tomorrow.",
"challengeStoryDesc430":"[Zheng De claps and exclaims,] Perfect! Gather our boys and prepare the tools. Time is ticking! And be discreet.",
"challengeStoryDesc431":"Yes, my lord, I'll see it done!",
"challengeStoryDesc432":"[Everything happens in Zheng's mansion is all under your man's watch.]",
"challengeStoryDesc433":"As you expected, Zheng De will be on the move tomorrow night.",
"challengeStoryDesc434":"[Today is the day the salt merchant's funeral as planned. All of his servants go to send him off.]",
"challengeStoryDesc435":"[Meanwhile, Zheng De is watching the funeral parade from afar in secret with his men.]",
"challengeStoryDesc436":"Breaking into this grave would be a piece of cake. I'll get rich tonight.",
"challengeStoryDesc437":"Hahaha, congratulations, master!",
"challengeStoryDesc438":"[Zheng De whacks his butler on the back of his head.] Shh! Keep it down!",
"challengeStoryDesc439":"[When the funeral's over, it's already late. The merchant's servants have all gone home whereas Shan Ji's soldiers keep waiting in the bushes.]",
"challengeStoryDesc440":"Boys, it's midnight—time to work! Dig, but carefully and gently. If any of you damages one item, I'll make sure that guy suffers when we get home.",
"challengeStoryDesc441":"[After two hours of digging, Zheng De's men have finally made their way to the crypt entrance.]",
"challengeStoryDesc442":"Look, master! Look!",
"challengeStoryDesc443":"[Finding the scene hard to believe, Zhang De and his men's eyes are wide open.]",
"challengeStoryDesc444":"Hahaha, Look at the gifts from the heavens! They are at my fingertips! Hahaha!",
"challengeStoryDesc445":"[Zheng De and his gang find heads of burial jade wares inside the crypt. They celebrate in excitement.]",
"challengeStoryDesc446":"[While they are immersed in the wonderland, you activate the switch to shut the crypt gate.]",
"challengeStoryDesc447":"Eek, the door's closed by itself! Master! What should we do?",
"challengeStoryDesc448":"Wraiths! Ghosts! Nooo... Help!",
"challengeStoryDesc449":"[You get on the move while the grave robbers are in chaos.]",
"challengeStoryDesc450":"Soldiers, surround the crypt.",
"challengeStoryDesc451":"Soldiers, get them!",
"challengeStoryDesc452":"[When the crypt reopens, Zheng De and his gang are stunned by the scene in their field of vision.]",
"challengeStoryDesc453":"Lord Zheng, looks like you are all good now. Digging a grave in the middle of the night?",
"challengeStoryDesc454":"You sneaky fellow, how dare you set my master up!",
"challengeStoryDesc455":"As the Minister of Etiquette, you have put the Imperial Court to shame for committing such an immoral crime!",
"challengeStoryDesc456":"Crafty rat! Can't believe I fell for your trick!",
"challengeStoryDesc457":"Soldiers, arrest them all!",
"challengeStoryDesc458":"Yes, Sir!",
"challengeStoryDesc459":"You've got a pair of sharp eyes, indeed! We've caught the grave robbers effortlessly.",
"challengeStoryDesc460":"Thanks for your wise ruse, Mr. Ji.",
"challengeStoryDesc461":"I'm flattered.",
"challengeStoryDesc462":"[You complete the task assigned by the Court in record time. Your feat is widely spread among the ministers.]",
"challengeStoryDesc463":"[It seems that people's life is back to peace, yet soundlessly, a malaria plague creeps upon the innocent civilians.]",
"challengeStoryDesc464":"My lord, a bunch of people are gathered outside.",
"challengeStoryDesc465":"[Villagers, “My lord, please help us! My whole family is suffering from killer headaches, and we have no idea why!“]",
"challengeStoryDesc466":"Oh, no. The malaria from the neighboring villages must have spread to our town.",
"challengeStoryDesc467":"Eh, really? I've heard that this malaria is extremely hard to cure yet highly infectious. My lord, My Lord, come back into the mansion. You can't get sick too!",
"challengeStoryDesc468":"[Villagers, “No! Milord, please save us!“",
"challengeStoryDesc469":"As an Imperial official, how can I fear death? Worry not, folks, for I am a man of responsibility.",
"challengeStoryDesc470":"[The widely-spread malaria crisis is beyond your depth, so you set off immediately to the capital to see the Imperial Doctors' help.]",
"challengeStoryDesc471":"My lord, I suggest you stay at home. There will be hordes of infected civilians along your journey. What if you get infected, too? The whole town would lose its mainstay.",
"challengeStoryDesc472":"My lord, Mr. Su is right. Besides, it would take Mr. Su less time to ride to the capital alone. So that His Majesty can approve our requirement for the Imperial Doctors' help sooner.",
"challengeStoryDesc473":"Alright, the town is counting on you. Be careful on your way, Mr. Su.",
"challengeStoryDesc474":"[Su Qi'er bids you farewell and speeds off towards the capital.]",
"challengeStoryDesc475":"[At this time, Feng Yuntian and Shan Ji arrive at your mansion as well.]",
"challengeStoryDesc476":"My brothers! What brings you...",
"challengeStoryDesc477":"I can't believe Shaxian County is plagued as well. Most of my soldiers caught malaria when fighting the flood on the frontline not long ago.",
"challengeStoryDesc478":"Brothers, please don't worry. Mr. Su is on his way to get the Imperial Doctors here from the capital.",
"challengeStoryDesc479":"My lord, our top priority now is to quarantine those who have been infected so as to control the epidemic.",
"challengeStoryDesc480":"Mr. Liu is right!",
"challengeStoryDesc481":"[After appeasing the infected, you have them quarantined. The epidemic is under control for now.]",
"challengeStoryDesc482":"[Two days later, Su Qi'er comes back with Zhang Guangyang (Imperial Doctor, RANK 6) at last.]",
"challengeStoryDesc483":"[After his diagnosis, the folks are infected with malaria as you expected.]",
"challengeStoryDesc484":"[After seeing the patients, Zhang Guangyang flees from the quarantine zone with hands covering his nose.]",
"challengeStoryDesc485":"Lord Zhang, is it curable?",
"challengeStoryDesc486":"Oh please, look at you, all panicking! It's just malaria! I, Zhang Guangyang, can cure anything!",
"challengeStoryDesc487":"Great! We have hope!",
"challengeStoryDesc488":"Don't celebrate too soon. The key ingredient for malaria remedy, gastrodia, is an extremely rare herb. Give me a couple of days to search for it!",
"challengeStoryDesc489":"Is there anything I can help with?",
"challengeStoryDesc490":"What do you know? It must be done by me and me alone.",
"challengeStoryDesc491":"What a cranky doctor! Don't know if he's as good as he claims.",
"challengeStoryDesc492":"Hey, don't talk to my master like that. Do you think you are better than him? Come on, then, you cure those patients.",
"challengeStoryDesc493":"[Eeveryone is unhappy with the Imperial Doctor's arrogance but there's nothing they can do about him.]",
"challengeStoryDesc494":"[It turns out this Imperial Doctor is a lecher. He spends his days in Blossom Club in the name of searching for the herbs.]",
"challengeStoryDesc495":"[As day passes by, the patients' condition suddenly worsens.]",
"challengeStoryDesc496":"My Lord, help! Help! Lots of the patients are foaming in their mouths and writhing in agony!",
"challengeStoryDesc497":"Get Lord Zhang now!",
"challengeStoryDesc498":"Your town is located in a barren area, after days of my diligent foraging, I've found nothing at all. Looks like you'll have to implore the throne for gastrodia.",
"challengeStoryDesc499":"Mr. Su, rush to the capital to apply for the herbs right now.",
"challengeStoryDesc500":"Yes, Sir!",
"challengeStoryDesc501":"Wait, wait! Hold on a minute! You know nothing about medicine, I'll undertake this task myself.",
"challengeStoryDesc502":"Great! With your help, the Imperial Court will approve our application for surely.",
"challengeStoryDesc503":"[The next day, Zhang Guangyang returns to the capital for the herb application.]",
"challengeStoryDesc504":"My lord, my lord, here come the herbs.",
"challengeStoryDesc505":"Oh, perfect! Boil it into decoctions for the patients.",
"challengeStoryDesc506":"Where is your master?",
"challengeStoryDesc507":"The salt merchant's daughter has also infected with malaria, my master's gone to treat her at the moment and will be here tomorrow! Just make your decoctions, quickly!",
"challengeStoryDesc508":"[After taking the remedy from the Imperial Court, the folks appear to get slightly better.]",
"challengeStoryDesc509":"Why does Lord Zhang prioritize the salt merchant's daughter over so many sick folks?",
"challengeStoryDesc510":"He doesn't look like an honest person to me.",
"challengeStoryDesc511":"[You find out that the salt merchant paid the Imperial Doctor extra money to ask him to see his daughter first.]",
"challengeStoryDesc512":"My Lord, the patients are puking all over the place again today.",
"challengeStoryDesc513":"Can this doctor cure the disease or not?",
"challengeStoryDesc514":"[As you complain, Zhang Guangyang walks into the room and snaps,] I can't cure the disease? How dare you malign an Imperial Doctor?",
"challengeStoryDesc515":"Mr. Su, watch your language!",
"challengeStoryDesc516":"Lord Zhang, the patients vomited again. Please go see them.",
"challengeStoryDesc517":"[Zhang Guang snorts,] Increase the dose. Put more into the pots!",
"challengeStoryDesc518":"Did you only decoct a little amount of the herbs? Stingy!",
"challengeStoryDesc519":"You...",
"challengeStoryDesc520":"[Although the Imperial Doctor was sent by the Imperial Court, he's never around when he's needed.]",
"challengeStoryDesc521":"The Imperial Court doesn't care about people's lives at all. All he does is go out for personal stuff all the time. I find this thing questionable.",
"challengeStoryDesc522":"Tail him. See where he goes every day.",
"challengeStoryDesc523":"[Shan Ji comes to see you now.]",
"challengeStoryDesc524":"Brother, my soldiers aren't getting any better after taking the remedy from the Imperial Court.",
"challengeStoryDesc525":"Same here, brother! It's nerve-racking!",
"challengeStoryDesc526":"Where is Zhang Guangyang! I need him to see my soldiers at our barracks.",
"challengeStoryDesc527":"I have no idea where he's gone. He's never home, it seems.",
"challengeStoryDesc528":"[Zhang Guangyang is surprisingly very wary, even Su Qi'er, a professional tracker, loses track of him.]",
"challengeStoryDesc529":"[On Su Qi'er's way back home, he runs into the salt merchant's daughter, who has already fully recovered and is having a joyful chat with her maid.]",
"challengeStoryDesc530":"Excuse me, lady, are you the daughter of the salt merchant?",
"challengeStoryDesc531":"[Salt merchant's daughter, “Yes, I am. You've got a good memory, sir. You did a great thing for the folks with my father last time for putting those grave robbers in prison.]",
"challengeStoryDesc532":"I heard that you were down with malaria. How are you in good shape so soon?",
"challengeStoryDesc533":"[Salt merchant's daughter, “Of course I am. My dad paid good money to get the Imperial Doctor, who came from the capital, to cure me. He's a miraculous doctor indeed!",
"challengeStoryDesc534":"Oh, is that so?",
"challengeStoryDesc535":"[After the chat with the salt merchant's daughter, Su Qi'er returns to the mansion at full speed.]",
"challengeStoryDesc536":"My lord, I just had a chat with the salt merchant's daughter on the street.",
"challengeStoryDesc537":"Hmm? Wasn't she down with malaria too?",
"challengeStoryDesc538":"[Su Qi'er repeats word by word what the girl just said to you.]",
"challengeStoryDesc539":"What is this Zhang Guangyang even up to?",
"challengeStoryDesc540":"He's a swindler!",
"challengeStoryDesc541":"[You begin to have doubts about the herbs from the Imperial Court.]",
"challengeStoryDesc542":"Yuan Fang, get Tan Yan (A local doctor) here for me, please!",
"challengeStoryDesc543":"[Tan Yan checks the herb from the Imperial Court and says, “This isn't gastrodia! It's just a common herb!]",
"challengeStoryDesc544":"Doctor Tan, are you sure?",
"challengeStoryDesc545":"[After double-authentication, Doctor Tan ensures you that it is a common herb with a moderate cooling effect.]",
"challengeStoryDesc546":"The Imperial Doctor has fooled us with a nonmedical herb! he has no regard for the lives of the civilians at all!",
"challengeStoryDesc547":"I'll kill him now!",
"challengeStoryDesc548":"Wait, brother! I think he must have swapped the real remedy with this.",
"challengeStoryDesc549":"No wonder he volunteered to go to the capital myself when I offered to do the job.",
"challengeStoryDesc550":"It was my fault.",
"challengeStoryDesc551":"First thing first, we must find the remedial herbs. Let's keep a low profile, though, we don't want to alert this guy.",
"challengeStoryDesc552":"Not long ago, as I walk past Blossom Club, I saw Zhang Guangyang coming out of the building. Perhaps he...",
"challengeStoryDesc553":"This cursed doctor. The folks' lives are in peril whereas he's out there enjoying himself!",
"challengeStoryDesc554":"[You decide to plant your men inside Blossom Club.]",
"challengeStoryDesc555":"Mr. Ji, please pretend to be a customer in Blossom Club!",
"challengeStoryDesc556":"[A while later, Ji Xiaolan spots Zhang Guangyang in the club.]",
"challengeStoryDesc557":"[Right now, Zhang Guangyang is talking to someone wearing expensive garments.]",
"challengeStoryDesc558":"[Ji Xiaolan calls Madam Hua, the hostess over and enquires.]",
"challengeStoryDesc559":"Madam, do you know who that person wearing expensive clothes is?",
"challengeStoryDesc560":"Aw, don't you know him? That's the renowned Li Laocai, the Minister of Transport, a Rank 6 officer!",
"challengeStoryDesc561":"[Having told Madam Hua to keep the investigation a secret, Ji Xiaolan offers her some silver coins to pry into their conversation.]",
"challengeStoryDesc562":"[Madam Hua happily takes the coins and eavesdrops on their conversation when pouring tea from the guests.]",
"challengeStoryDesc563":"Sir, they were super wary during their talk but I've got sensitive hearing!",
"challengeStoryDesc564":"Oh!? Tell me everything!",
"challengeStoryDesc565":"Li Laocai said something about the gastro... anyway, the stuff is on the way to Rong Town.",
"challengeStoryDesc566":"Also, the profit is 50-50 or something...",
"challengeStoryDesc567":"[After getting the intel, Ji Xiaolan comes back from Blossom Club to retell everything to you.]",
"challengeStoryDesc568":"[The disgusting man totally disregards human lives! Mr. Su, go after the herbs!",
"challengeStoryDesc569":"Wait! Rong Town is hundreds of miles way from here. By the time he gets the herbs back, the civilians would have been dead already.",
"challengeStoryDesc570":"What should we do then?",
"challengeStoryDesc571":"[Everyone is extremely worried seeing as the patients' condition has taken a turn for the worse.]",
"challengeStoryDesc572":"My lord, I have an idea!",
"challengeStoryDesc573":"What idea?",
"challengeStoryDesc574":"gastrodia is a rare herb, why don't we ask the Imperial Court for more? When Zhang Guangyang swaps them again, we catch him on the spot!",
"challengeStoryDesc575":"Brilliant idea, Mr. Ji!",
"challengeStoryDesc576":"People's health comes first. We must have him go to the capital again now.",
"challengeStoryDesc577":"[You ask Zhang Guangyang if he could go back to the Imperial Court for more herbs.]",
"challengeStoryDesc578":"You sure use up the herbs fast. Well then, I shall get more herbs from the capital again for our people.",
"challengeStoryDesc579":"[You send Su Qi'er to tail him when Zhang Guangyang sets off.]",
"challengeStoryDesc580":"[As expected, Zhang Guangyang stops by a tavern a few hours longer than he should on his way back.]",
"challengeStoryDesc581":"[Su Qi'er rides back at full speed to report his stay. You and your men immediately rush to the tavern.]",
"challengeStoryDesc582":"[Zhang Guangyang orders his men to move gastrodia to somewhere else after swapping the bags of valuable herbs with some cheap stuff. ]",
"challengeStoryDesc583":"[You catch up the carts and control the herbs.]",
"challengeStoryDesc584":"[Then you go to the tavern and, acting like it's just an accident, you run into Zhang Guangyang during your meal.] Lord Zhang, you are back at last.",
"challengeStoryDesc585":"[Zhang Guang is terrified out of his wits when he sees you.]",
"challengeStoryDesc586":"[Zhang Guangyang keeps up a calm facade, he points at the swapped bags and says,] Yeah, yeah. I get the herbs back despite all the bumpiness along the way.",
"challengeStoryDesc587":"Soldiers, check the herbs!",
"challengeStoryDesc588":"[After inspection.] My lord, this isn't gastrodia!",
"challengeStoryDesc589":"Zhang Guangyang! As an Imperial Doctor, you disregard people's lives. Do you admit the crime of swapping the remedy for malaria with nonmedical herbs?!",
"challengeStoryDesc590":"Mr. Su, arrest him!",
"challengeStoryDesc591":"[Zhang Guangyang denies with chicaneries but you put the real remedy you captured before him, the doctor goes speechless.]",
"challengeStoryDesc592":"[At the same time, Minister of Transport's butler watches the whole thing happening in the corner.]",
"challengeStoryDesc593":"[Li Laocai, a man of extreme prudence, sent his butler to watch over the delivery of the herbs in secret.",
"challengeStoryDesc594":"[Back to town, Zhang Guangyang decocts the remedy under your watch and gets thrown into the prison afterward.]",
"challengeStoryDesc595":"[Three days later, the folks graduate to a healthy state.]",
"challengeStoryDesc596":"Answer me! Who's with you? Who's behind this abominable crime?",
"challengeStoryDesc597":"I did it on my own, no one's behind this. Just do whatever you want to do!",
"challengeStoryDesc598":"Huh! Aren't you unrepentantly loyal?",
"challengeStoryDesc599":"Stop, please stop! I know I've sinned! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!",
"challengeStoryDesc600":"Don't worry, I won't execute you just yet. We still need to find out who's behind all this!",
"challengeStoryDesc601":"[The Minister of Transport's butler has returned and told Li Laocai (Minister of Transport) that Zhang Guangyang has been arrested.]",
"challengeStoryDesc602":"Useless idiot! He can't even move stuff right!",
"challengeStoryDesc603":"Butler, kill Zhang Guangyang in jail in case he sells me out.",
"challengeStoryDesc604":"Yes, sir!",
"challengeStoryDesc605":"[In the dead of a moonless night, the assassin makes his move.]",
"challengeStoryDesc606":"[Having predicted that someone will come to end the doctor's life, you have moved Zhang Guangyang to Shan Ji's barrack beforehand.]",
"challengeStoryDesc607":"[After sneaking into the prison, the assassin only sees Zhang Guangyang's butler. He puts his sword against his neck and asks,] Where is your master?",
"challengeStoryDesc608":"Don't-don't kill me. I-I don't know where he is either! Please have mercy!",
"challengeStoryDesc609":"[Once you hear something in the prison, you rush to surround the cell right away.]",
"challengeStoryDesc610":"Who dares to break into the prison?",
"challengeStoryDesc611":"You want to get me? I'd like to see you try!",
"challengeStoryDesc612":"You think you can escape? I'd like to see YOU try!",
"challengeStoryDesc613":"[Even under rigorous torture, Zhang Guangyang still refuses to give you a name, so you decide to dig information out of the assassin's mouth.]",
"challengeStoryDesc614":"Tell me, who is the ringleader?",
"challengeStoryDesc615":"I'd rather die than tell you!",
"challengeStoryDesc616":"Ooh, you're an obstinate one, aren't you?",
"challengeStoryDesc617":"I'll spare your life if you give me a name!",
"challengeStoryDesc618":"I'm not afraid of death!",
"challengeStoryDesc619":"Guards, cane him first, then dismember him!",
"challengeStoryDesc620":"There's no point in keeping him around. We might as well get rid of him.",
"challengeStoryDesc621":"[You pretend to agree with Su Qu'er.]",
"challengeStoryDesc622":"[As soon as the assassin hears the word “dismember“ and sees you have no intention to stop it, he cries out lout.]",
"challengeStoryDesc623":"My lord, my lord! Please, spare my life! Are you really going to kill me? I didn't do anything!",
"challengeStoryDesc624":"I'll talk, I'll talk. I'll tell you everything I know.",
"challengeStoryDesc625":"[It turns out that the assassin is actually quite a coward. In the end, he admits that he was sent by Li Laocai.]",
"challengeStoryDesc626":"[Good news comes from Shan Ji's barrack too.]",
"challengeStoryDesc627":"[Zhang Guangyang, unable to withstand the torment in the prison any longer, finally reveals the whereabouts of the herbs.]",
"challengeStoryDesc628":"Excellent! Now that we've got all the evidence we need, it's time to capture Li Laocai!",
"challengeStoryDesc629":"Let's find the hidden herbs first.",
"challengeStoryDesc630":"Brother, I know where the herbs are!",
"challengeStoryDesc631":"[As a tradition, the tenth of every month is the market day in Rong Town, apothecaries from around the nation will gather there to purchase high-quality medicinal materials.]",
"challengeStoryDesc632":"The tenth? Isn't that the day after tomorrow?",
"challengeStoryDesc633":"Soldiers, get the horses ready! We set out now!",
"challengeStoryDesc634":"I'll gather my troops as well.",
"challengeStoryDesc635":"Thanks, brother!",
"challengeStoryDesc636":"[Li Laocai believes that the assassin has shut Zhang Guangyang's mouth for good, but this circumspect man still decides to sell all the herbs on the market day in case of future trouble.]",
"challengeStoryDesc637":"[You and your men disguise yourselves as apothecaries and arrive a day before the market day at Rong Town.]",
"challengeStoryDesc638":"[The next morning, the market is teeming with people as expected.]",
"challengeStoryDesc639":"[Ji Xain spots Minister of Transport's butler and says,] My lord, that's Li Laocai's butler.",
"challengeStoryDesc640":"[Yuan Fang, pretending to be an intrigued buyer, trudges over.] Is this gastrodia you are selling?",
"challengeStoryDesc641":"You are asking the right guy and yes, it is gastrodia. And even better, it's gastrodia straight from the Imperial Court!",
"challengeStoryDesc642":"[After double-checking it's the right herb, Yuan Fang says,] I'll take them all!",
"challengeStoryDesc643":"[The butler is astonished, then he asks someone to fetch his master here.]",
"challengeStoryDesc644":"Do you know how much these herbs cost?",
"challengeStoryDesc645":"Do you own these herbs? I want to buy them all!",
"challengeStoryDesc646":"[Hearing Yuan Fang's assertive tone, Li Laocai answers greasily,] Yes, yes, they are all mine!",
"challengeStoryDesc647":"[The time is now, you and your gang show your true identities.]",
"challengeStoryDesc648":"Li Laocai! As Minister of Transport, you smuggle the remedy for malaria from the throne with Imperial Doctor Zhang! The evidence right is before us! Soldiers, arrest this maggot.",
"challengeStoryDesc649":"[Li Laocai still tries to lie but when you get Zhang Guangyang in front of him, he's out of words.",
"challengeStoryDesc650":"Li Laocai, you dirty bastard. Wanted to shut me up for good in prison, huh? We'll meet in court!",
"challengeStoryDesc651":"[You've got the witness and the herbs. Li Laocai has got nothing to say during his trial.]",
"challengeStoryDesc652":"[Folks listening outside the gate cheer and rejoice. They hold you in even higher reverence now.]",
"challengeStoryDesc653":"[March is approaching, the news is out that it's about time for the South Tour of the emperor.]",
"challengeStoryDesc654":"[Prince Baylor has noticed you for quite long since you have won applause among the Imperial Court for the good deeds you've done for the people.]",
"challengeStoryDesc655":"[Prince Baylor pre-checks the route incognito and you are the sole company by his secret order.]",
"challengeStoryDesc656":"Congratulations, my lord, for being valued by the Imperial Court!",
"challengeStoryDesc657":"Congratulations, we are following the right person!",
"challengeStoryDesc658":"Prince Baylor's pre-South Tour is quite important, I'm not sure if I can do the job well.",
"challengeStoryDesc659":"Relax, my lord, we'll be your brain trust.",
"challengeStoryDesc660":"[After receiving Prince Baylor's secret order, you and your men set off to meet up with him in Yangzhou.]",
"challengeStoryDesc661":"My lord, you and I will be separated for many days. Please take care of yourself.",
"challengeStoryDesc662":"I will, Xiaolian, I'll be fine with my confidants. You take care of sister and the kids.",
"challengeStoryDesc663":"[Three days later, you meet up with Prince Baylor in Yangzhou.]",
"challengeStoryDesc664":"Sorry to keep you waiting for me, Your Highness.",
"challengeStoryDesc665":"Dear lord, please pay attention to everything along the South Tour route.",
"challengeStoryDesc666":"The South Tour is likely to be preponed this time. We must speed up the route inspection.",
"challengeStoryDesc667":"Prince Baylor, trust me, we'll make sure the route the emperor takes is absolutely secure.",
"challengeStoryDesc668":"I know all about your recent feats but this is His Majesty's safety, we must be extra meticulous.",
"challengeStoryDesc669":"Thank you, Your Highness, for your trust in me. I guarantee that you won't be disappointed!",
"challengeStoryDesc670":"You pass by an embroidery house, you notice a middle-aged embroideress working on an exquisite embroidery of a knight hunting a tiger.]",
"challengeStoryDesc671":"[Prince Baylor likes it very much so he asks,] How much is it?",
"challengeStoryDesc672":"[Head down, back towards you, the embroideress is focused on working on her canvas. She repeats,] No matter how much you pay, I won't sell it!",
"challengeStoryDesc673":"Really? How matter how much I pay?",
"challengeStoryDesc674":"Do you know who's wanting to buy it?",
"challengeStoryDesc675":"[You stop Su Qi'er just before the name popped out of his mouth.]",
"challengeStoryDesc676":"Su Qi'er! The South Tour route is classified. Don't you be reckless!",
"challengeStoryDesc677":"Yes, Sir!",
"challengeStoryDesc678":"You are more thoughtful, my lord.",
"challengeStoryDesc679":"[The embroideress says from aside, “I won't even sell this to the throne, so why would I sell it to you?“]",
"challengeStoryDesc680":"[Prince Baylor looks miffed but he's restricted from revealing his true identity.]",
"challengeStoryDesc681":"Kind Lady, may I ask if this embroidery has already got a buyer?",
"challengeStoryDesc682":"[The embroideress answers, “It is a birthday present for city magistrate Lord Zhao's father.]",
"challengeStoryDesc683":"[You head to a teahouse for refreshments and enjoy the nice view of the canals and peaceful town life.]",
"challengeStoryDesc684":"Any seats left upstairs?",
"challengeStoryDesc685":"[The teahouse tender squints at you and says,] No. The entire second floor is reserved by Administrator Zhao. Unless the emperor is here, no one is allowed to take a seat there.",
"challengeStoryDesc686":"The administrator again? Who is this Lord Zhao anyway?",
"challengeStoryDesc687":"Everyone in this town knows Magistrate Zhao. He's also got a nickname, the Gold Bucket.",
"challengeStoryDesc688":"Hmm... Why the Gold Bucket?",
"challengeStoryDesc689":"One time, Lord Zhao was moving into his new mansion, the bottom of a crate his servants were carrying cracked open, the golds and jewels inside the crate filled up 7 rice buckets. That was how he got the nickname, the Gold Bucket.",
"challengeStoryDesc690":"[The nickname amuses you.]",
"challengeStoryDesc691":"If a local magistrate's golds and jewels could fill up 7 buckets, he can't be a good guy.",
"challengeStoryDesc692":"[You become interested in learning more about this Lord Zhao's background.]",
"challengeStoryDesc693":"Man, can you tell us more about this the Gold Bucket?",
"challengeStoryDesc694":"[Since you ask, the tender fires away.]",
"challengeStoryDesc695":"Magistrate Zhao often makes rounds in town in casual clothing to learn about people's lives. He covers all the nearby towns and counties every month.",
"challengeStoryDesc696":"Hmm? He sounds like a good officer then.",
"challengeStoryDesc697":"A good officer?",
"challengeStoryDesc698":"I assume it's your visit to our town, right?",
"challengeStoryDesc699":"Well, it is our first time here.",
"challengeStoryDesc700":"The truth is that under his people-caring facade, Lord Zhao has actually been doing things illicit.",
"challengeStoryDesc701":"Something illicit!?",
"challengeStoryDesc702":"Everywhere he goes, he picks the tiniest holes in his subordinates' daily work, and faults will be punished. The punishment has always been, you know, money.",
"challengeStoryDesc703":"[You and Prince Baylor exchange glances and chuckle.]",
"challengeStoryDesc704":"I'd like to meet this Lord Zhao.",
"challengeStoryDesc705":"He's not someone you get to meet whenever you want to.",
"challengeStoryDesc706":"[On your way out, you hear some other customers gossiping the Gold Bucket too.]",
"challengeStoryDesc707":"[It seems Zhao Kang has just laid the Mayor of Kunshan County off.]",
"challengeStoryDesc708":"Hey, do you know what happened in Kunshan County?",
"challengeStoryDesc709":"Sure I do! Zhao Kang is one of our favorite gossip topics.",
"challengeStoryDesc710":"Tell us what happened then!",
"challengeStoryDesc711":"[One day, Zhao Kang went to Kunshan County to instruct the mayor to arrange more guards along the South Tour route.]",
"challengeStoryDesc712":"Mayor of Kunshan County has a nickname Qian Hutu, who is an alcoholic. And that day, after his daily dose of alcohol, he dozed off on the desk when reviewing cases, Zhao Kang happened to walk into the room.",
"challengeStoryDesc713":"Zhao Kang whacked on the desk in rage. Qian Hutu snapped awake and bowed over and over again in terror to his superior.",
"challengeStoryDesc714":"Everyone knows the Gold Bucket is a greedy pig, as does Qian Hutu. He whispered to him that there was a full wagon of gold and jewels waiting outside to be delivered to Zhao Kang's mansion.",
"challengeStoryDesc715":"And you know what? Zhao Kang took the bribe and sacked Qian Hutu anyway.",
"challengeStoryDesc716":"Zhao Kang is a calculating fellow but he did punish quite a few slacking officials.",
"challengeStoryDesc717":"He did take bribes though. He deserves a punishment for that.",
"challengeStoryDesc718":"[The teahouse tender figures that you aren't common civilians after hearing what you said.]",
"challengeStoryDesc719":"Where do you come from again? Did you just say you are gonna punish Zhao Kang?",
"challengeStoryDesc720":"Zhao Kang isn't an easy target, you know!",
"challengeStoryDesc721":"[The tender continues,] Zhao Kang's father was the emperor's childhood study pal.",
"challengeStoryDesc722":"Zhao An, is it?",
"challengeStoryDesc723":"Pri... [The name Prince Baylor nearly pops out of your mouth, luckily you catch yourself in time.]",
"challengeStoryDesc724":"Ah, I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Pang Jian, commonly known as Lord Third.",
"challengeStoryDesc725":"I see, I see! Lord Third.",
"challengeStoryDesc726":"Do you know Zhao An?",
"challengeStoryDesc727":"I've heard of him.",
"challengeStoryDesc728":"[The tender cuts in before Prince Baylor says more.]",
"challengeStoryDesc729":"The emperor favors Zhao An a lot. Every South Tour, the Zhaos would spend loads of money to feast the royal march.",
"challengeStoryDesc730":"First of all, he studied with the emperor. Secondly, he knows many royals. No one dares to displease the Zhaos around this area.",
"challengeStoryDesc731":"It truly is hard to deal with an influential family like this.",
"challengeStoryDesc732":"Is our emperor too blind to see the malfeasants? Everybody is equal before the law, why is Zhao Kang an exception?",
"challengeStoryDesc733":"Su Qi'er, what impudence!",
"challengeStoryDesc734":"Our emperor is just and impartial. I bet one of the Zhaos' royal acquaintances covered His Majesty's eyes.",
"challengeStoryDesc735":"[You realize that you might have talked too much in the teahouse so you check out and leave.]",
"challengeStoryDesc736":"[The tender watches you walk out of the building and scorns,] Who do these outsiders think they are to speak like that?",
"challengeStoryDesc737":"[The civilians are aware of the upcoming South Tour but no one knows the precise route or schedule.]",
"challengeStoryDesc738":"[Zhao Kang the Gold Bucket doesn't have the balls to extort people for money for the time being but he is still that greedy pig as he always is. Something is on his mind.]",
"challengeStoryDesc739":"When exactly will His Majesty be going on the South Tour? I'm so bored!",
"challengeStoryDesc740":"My master, I have got something for your amusement. Would you like to hear?",
"challengeStoryDesc741":"Come out, say it! I'm so sick of the boredom!",
"challengeStoryDesc742":"You see, we don't have a nice temple in town. What if we build one prior to the South Tour? That way, His Majesty will be impressed while you, my master, can get some out of it...",
"challengeStoryDesc743":"Haha, you prove your worth. I like this idea, hahahaha!",
"challengeStoryDesc744":"Well, I learn from the best!",
"challengeStoryDesc745":"Butler, post an announcement out there. We Yangzhou are gonna have our own temple! Great!",
"challengeStoryDesc746":"[The announcement says, to aid in the construction of the first temple of our county, each household must contribute something to the common good. Soldiers will be collecting taxes door to door three days later.]",
"challengeStoryDesc747":"[There's a mix of feelings among the civilians, some are happy, some are distressed.]",
"challengeStoryDesc748":"[The whole county is discussing, “We've had a terrible harvest this year! How are we supposed to contribute any money to the temple construction?“]",
"challengeStoryDesc749":"Building a temple is a great deed, which will bring glory to the county. By Magistrate Zhao's order, each household must contribute food and money. Alright, you've seen it, off you go!",
"challengeStoryDesc750":"[You and your fellows happen to be passing through the city gate. The folks are complaining and whining, you approach them to find out why.]",
"challengeStoryDesc751":"This freaking Gold Bucket! He intends to exploit the people by building a temple.",
"challengeStoryDesc752":"[Su Qi'er's denounces with eyes filled with indignation.] Shameless!",
"challengeStoryDesc753":"Fellows, chill out. Think about it, this is our opportunity!",
"challengeStoryDesc754":"[You are confused by what Prince Baylor said.]",
"challengeStoryDesc755":"Who do you mean by our opportunity?",
"challengeStoryDesc756":"We wanted to punish Zhao Kang but we didn't know where to start. Now you see, opportunity knocks.",
"challengeStoryDesc757":"Hahaha, Pri... I mean, Lord Third, very insightful of you.",
"challengeStoryDesc758":"I would never have thought of it!",
"challengeStoryDesc759":"The proclamation says that the soldiers will levy money on the civilians three days later door to door. There's bound to be some families that have nothing to give.",
"challengeStoryDesc760":"I heard the farmlands in Jiangnan were all ruined by a pest plague this year. None of the families will have spare grains to turn in.",
"challengeStoryDesc761":"Let's head back to the inn to discuss how to bust Zhao Kang.",
"challengeStoryDesc762":"Time's short, let's go!",
"challengeStoryDesc763":"[What concerns you is that you don't have your own soldiers in Yangzhou. The chances are, you are going to be outnumbered.]",
"challengeStoryDesc764":"He's the host, we are the guests. We can carry out this arrest but what if he goes all out at us in desperation? We can't take that risk.",
"challengeStoryDesc765":"Looks like we need reinforcement.",
"challengeStoryDesc766":"My lord, Shan Ji's barrack isn't far away from here. The carrier pigeon can deliver the message in two days.",
"challengeStoryDesc767":"Yeah, I almost forgot Brother Shan.",
"challengeStoryDesc768":"Is this Shan Ji reliable?",
"challengeStoryDesc769":"Shan Ji is a sworn brother of mine. We've been through weal and woe!",
"challengeStoryDesc770":"We must keep it secret. Our identities can't be exposed.",
"challengeStoryDesc771":"Sure, Prince Baylor. I'll ask Shan Ji to travel here in disguise in the letter.",
"challengeStoryDesc772":"It's urgent, send the message now.",
"challengeStoryDesc773":"Yes, Your Highness!",
"challengeStoryDesc774":"[The pigeon carries the letter to Shan Ji's barrack soon. Shan Ji sets out to Yangzhou the very night.]",
"challengeStoryDesc775":"[Three days later, Zhao Kang really takes a large group of soldiers to levy taxes on the folks door to door.]",
"challengeStoryDesc776":"[You and your men have come early to watch the streets.]",
"challengeStoryDesc777":"[As expected, many families have no food to turn in at all. Folks kneel on the ground to beg for Zhao Kang's mercy.]",
"challengeStoryDesc778":"Bah! Aren't you all living in a well-off life? The county is now in need of your money, it's for the common good! Are you hiding your money away from me?",
"challengeStoryDesc779":"Soldiers, search their houses! Confiscate all the valuable stuff!",
"challengeStoryDesc780":"Stop there! Zhao Kang, as an official serves the Imperial Court, you abuse power and exploit the people. I'll end your malfeasance today on behalf of the Court.",
"challengeStoryDesc781":"Ha, this is the first time I get challenged on my territory. I'd like to see who's got the upper hand here!",
"challengeStoryDesc782":"Boys, take this insolent gang down!",
"challengeStoryDesc783":"[Shan Ji's soldiers arrive in the nick of time.]",
"challengeStoryDesc784":"Soldiers, protect my friends and capture Zhao Kang alive!",
"challengeStoryDesc785":"What? Where does this little brat come from? How dare you and your pathetic little pack fight against me?",
"challengeStoryDesc786":"After I put you all in custody, I will charge you with the crime of mutiny!",
"challengeStoryDesc787":"Absurd! As an official yourself, you know keeping soldiers and forging weapons without capital permission is a felony!",
"challengeStoryDesc788":"[Completely enraged, Prince Baylor pulls out his sword, meaning to capture Zhao Kang by himself.]",
"challengeStoryDesc789":"[You hold Prince Baylor back in a hurry in case he gets hurt in the chaotic combat.]",
"challengeStoryDesc790":"Pri... Sir Pang! Watch out! It’s no good to argue with this pest! Just leave him to us!",
"challengeStoryDesc791":"Yes. To honor the imperial order, we'll arrest him and his gang!",
"challengeStoryDesc792":"Bah! Thoughtful of you indeed! People, arrest this person and I shall reward you generously!",
"challengeStoryDesc793":"[On the other hand, Zhao Kang is still unrepentant.]",
"challengeStoryDesc794":"How bold of you to claim that you are under an imperial order?",
"challengeStoryDesc795":"Soldiers, take these mobs down! Show them the true imperial power!",
"challengeStoryDesc796":"[Swords out of the scabbards, *Clang Clunk*, weapons keep clashing.]",
"challengeStoryDesc797":"[Shan Ji steps forward to shield you and Prince Baylor.]",
"challengeStoryDesc798":"Brother, it's dangerous! You and Sir Pang go to that house to have a rest! I'll be right back!",
"challengeStoryDesc799":"[After a while, Shan Ji comes back with Zhao Kang under his control.]",
"challengeStoryDesc800":"It's very valiant of you, General Shan!",
"challengeStoryDesc801":"I'm flattered, Sir Pang! Like their master, these personal guards are a bunch of weaklings. They are no match for my elite soldiers.",
"challengeStoryDesc802":"Thank you for allowing me to dispatch the soldiers using your Token of Authority!",
"challengeStoryDesc803":"[Zhao Kang kneels next to Prince Baylor, still in denial of the crime he's committed.]",
"challengeStoryDesc804":"Let me go, you mobs! Show some respect for the law!",
"challengeStoryDesc805":"You mark my word, as long as Zhao family still controls Yangzhou, you'll never get to leave here! You'll see the consequences!",
"challengeStoryDesc806":"[Shan Ji sneers at Zhao Kang's fatuity,]",
"challengeStoryDesc807":"Tch, ignorance comes with impudence.",
"challengeStoryDesc808":"You-you listen to me! My family is favored by the throne! His Majesty always stays in our mansion during the South Tours! My father is His Majesty's childhood study pal!",
"challengeStoryDesc809":"Release me immediately! Then I will ask for my father's mercy!",
"challengeStoryDesc810":"[Prince Baylor is amused by Zhao Kang's boasts.]",
"challengeStoryDesc811":"Are you the son of Zhao An?",
"challengeStoryDesc812":"Arrgh! Who-who are you? How dare you call my father's name?",
"challengeStoryDesc813":"It doesn't matter who I am. What matters is that since you are Lord Zhao's son, it would be inappropriate for us to punish you. I'll turn you over to Lord Zhao then.",
"challengeStoryDesc814":"[Shan Ji tries to persuade Prince Baylor after hearing this whereas you figured Prince Baylor would do so, so you hold Shan Ji back.]",
"challengeStoryDesc815":"Let's wait and see. His Highness must have his own plan.",
"challengeStoryDesc816":"[Zhao Kang, however, thinks you are intimidated by his family influence while you are whispering to each other, he gloats again despite the fact that he's still under arrest.]",
"challengeStoryDesc817":"Pshh, a bunch of mobs acting chivalrous? Come on, bring me home then, let's see how my father deals with you lot!",
"challengeStoryDesc818":"[You take Zhao Kang back home and halt before his mansion. Tiles golden and walls red, this grand and sumptuous mansion doesn't look like a mere RANK 8 official's home at all.]",
"challengeStoryDesc819":"Hey, Gold Bucket, you've got a luxury mansion, haven't you? But...",
"challengeStoryDesc820":"Only princes are allowed to live a mansion with golden tiles and red walls. This is against conventions, don't you think?",
"challengeStoryDesc821":"Even His Majesty has to respect the old conventions.",
"challengeStoryDesc822":"[Prince Baylor feels offended.]",
"challengeStoryDesc823":"Ha, you lowlives, consider yourselves lucky because you only get to see this once in a lifetime...",
"challengeStoryDesc824":"[Shan Ji is enraged by Zhao Kang's swaggering taunt, he can't help but point his sword against Zhao Kang's neck.]",
"challengeStoryDesc825":"[But Zhao's butler sees this, he calls the guards over while walking up to you.]",
"challengeStoryDesc826":"Boy, oh, boy! Our young master, what happened to you? Hey, who the hell are you people? This is Zhao's mansion, show some respect! Put down your swords!",
"challengeStoryDesc827":"Our young master, why did you mess up with these thugs. Give me a minute, I'll get master here right now!",
"challengeStoryDesc828":"Guards, surround them! Keep them out of our mansion! Don't hurt our young master though!",
"challengeStoryDesc829":"[Inside the mansion, right before Zhao An tries to write a secret letter to His Majesty regarding the South Tour arrangement, the commotion outside snaps off his thread in mind. He tosses the pen aside in exasperation.]",
"challengeStoryDesc830":"Butler, what's going on outside? Can't you mind your volume?",
"challengeStoryDesc831":"[The butler scurries in and he still keeps gabbling.]",
"challengeStoryDesc832":"My lord, my lord! We've got a problem! A bunch of mobs is outside putting a sword on your son's neck! Come on out and have a look!",
"challengeStoryDesc833":"What? This is outrageous! Who dares to defy the Zhaos on my porch? Come on, to the gate with me!",
"challengeStoryDesc834":"Is my son hurt?",
"challengeStoryDesc835":"My lord, no injuries but the young master's in shock.",
"challengeStoryDesc836":"[Zhao An scuttles towards the front yard in a fume, but he stops halfway through as something pops into his mind.]",
"challengeStoryDesc837":"What did you say again? They are armed?",
"challengeStoryDesc838":"Y-yes! What-what's the matter, my lord?",
"challengeStoryDesc839":"Gather all the guards, you stupid! The trauma my son they give my son, I swear I will pay them back a hundredfold!",
"challengeStoryDesc840":"[With all the guards following him, Zhao An arrives at the front yard. Once he sees Shan Ji's sword on his son's neck, he can't help shaking in extreme anger.]",
"challengeStoryDesc841":"You mobs! Let go of son!",
"challengeStoryDesc842":"[Zhao Kang cries for help as soon as he hears his father's voice.]",
"challengeStoryDesc843":"Dad, save me! I was only raising funds for the construction of our county temple, these mobs came out of nowhere called me a malfeasant and battered me! Avenge me, dad!",
"challengeStoryDesc844":"You insolent rabble, do you know that my son is the local magistrate? Kidnapping a RANK 8 official is a felony! Release him now!",
"challengeStoryDesc845":"[Zhao An's self-righteousness makes you indignant.]",
"challengeStoryDesc846":"Since your son is a public official, why did you turn a blind eye to his exploitation of the people? The entire county is living in poverty!",
"challengeStoryDesc847":"[You take a tough stance, Zhao An perfunctorily agrees to you.]",
"challengeStoryDesc848":"Granted, my son wasn't thinking straight but His Majesty will embark on the South Tour soon. The temple is meant for the good of the people. It's an urgent project.",
"challengeStoryDesc849":"I admit that my son might have pushed this matter too hard. I apologize for him to you all, good sirs.",
"challengeStoryDesc850":"Let's put it behind us. When His Majesty comes to stay in my mansion during the South Tour, I will recommend you to him. Although I only used to be his humble study pal, my word still means something.",
"challengeStoryDesc851":"[Zhao An is being quite polite but with eyes rolling around, he looks unsettled. It seems he's waiting for something anxiously.]",
"challengeStoryDesc852":"Lord Zhao An, quit biding your time with us here. You are waiting for your guards, aren't you?",
"challengeStoryDesc853":"[A familiar voice comes from Zhao An's behind. It's Su Qi'er!]",
"challengeStoryDesc854":"Mr. Su!",
"challengeStoryDesc855":"[Su Qi'er bows to you.]",
"challengeStoryDesc856":"My lord, I did a little trick at the backyard, those guards won't be able to come here for the time being.",
"challengeStoryDesc857":"You are exceptionally thoughtful this time.",
"challengeStoryDesc858":"Um... Mr. Ji gave me this idea.",
"challengeStoryDesc859":"I see. I shall thank Mr. Ji after this then.",
"challengeStoryDesc860":"[The miscarriage of his plan vexes Zhao An, he unmasks the ambages.]",
"challengeStoryDesc861":"You plebs, don't you think I can do nothing about you without that bunch of trash at the backyard! You come to my house with my son in your hand, you don't get away with it!",
"challengeStoryDesc862":"Servants, arrest these thugs for breaking into a private property and kidnapping an official! All of them!",
"challengeStoryDesc863":"It's funny to see how fast this wretch changes his face.",
"challengeStoryDesc864":"It's the first time to see someone set his son's life aside. I bet they are of the same stripe.",
"challengeStoryDesc865":"Back up a bit, Sir Pang and my brother, leave them to me and Mr. Su!",
"challengeStoryDesc866":"[Zhao's servants barely knows how to fight. Soon, Shan Ji's soldiers have contained every one of them.]",
"challengeStoryDesc867":"Who are you? These equerries... Are you from the army?",
"challengeStoryDesc868":"You know better than your son.",
"challengeStoryDesc869":"Now that you know who we are, just come clean about all the malefactions you and your son have done with us!",
"challengeStoryDesc870":"Commanders, we did nothing maleficent. The Zhao family builds our status on ancestral savings and His Majesty's inclination.",
"challengeStoryDesc871":"We only wanted to benefit the folks. In addition, His Majesty will be staying in our mansion, how dare we break the laws at this time? Please, I plead for justice.",
"challengeStoryDesc872":"[Zhao An appears to be sincere but you can tell that he's still making excuses.]",
"challengeStoryDesc873":"Zhao An, if you keep being evasive, even His Majesty was here, you wouldn't be exonerated.",
"challengeStoryDesc874":"I... I am telling the truth. I dare not to pass the buck at all. But please, false charges are unfair, right?",
"challengeStoryDesc875":"Alright, alright.",
"challengeStoryDesc876":"[Prince Baylor gets tired of Zhao An's hypocrisy, he hints Shan Ji to take his personal token and Token of Authority out.]",
"challengeStoryDesc877":"Lord Zhao, do you recognize these?",
"challengeStoryDesc878":"[Zhao An takes the two tokens over and strokes on the golden dragon pattern. He starts to panic.]",
"challengeStoryDesc879":"I... Uh... This...",
"challengeStoryDesc880":"[Eyeballs rolling, Zhao An has a quick think. He then kneels straight before Prince Baylor and begs,]",
"challengeStoryDesc881":"How blind of me to fail to recognize you, Your Highness and the First Talent. Please forgive my fatuity! Spare our lives, please.",
"challengeStoryDesc882":"[Not only Zhao An dramatically humbles his attitude, but he also elbows his son's knee hard, compelling him to kneel down.]",
"challengeStoryDesc883":"[Zhao Kang's bent knees ram on to the stone porch so hard that he grimaces in pain.]",
"challengeStoryDesc884":"Ouch! Dad, what are you doing?",
"challengeStoryDesc885":"Get up, dad! Why should we kneel before these mobs?",
"challengeStoryDesc886":"[Zhao Kang struggles to get up from the ground.]",
"challengeStoryDesc887":"[Zhao An gives a glare at his feckless son and presses him down forcefully.]",
"challengeStoryDesc888":"Shut up, brat! Do you know who's standing in front of us? This is...",
"challengeStoryDesc889":"[Zhao An is on the verge of uncovering Prince Baylor's identity, he whacks his fan on his palm to cut Zhao An off.]",
"challengeStoryDesc890":"Ahem! I'm but a rambler. My name is Pang Jian, someone insignificant.",
"challengeStoryDesc891":"Sir Pang, please forgive us. We are just too blind to recognize you.",
"challengeStoryDesc892":"[Prince Baylor still feels unsure, he enjoins once again,]",
"challengeStoryDesc893":"Call me Sir Pang, please. I'm on a private trip, keep a low profile.",
"challengeStoryDesc894":"[“Yes, yes, yes.“ Zhao An keeps nodding insinuatingly.]",
"challengeStoryDesc895":"How dull of me!",
"challengeStoryDesc896":"[Zhao An then drives his men away.]",
"challengeStoryDesc897":"Go, go, you aren't needed here. It's all been a misunderstanding. Right, my lord?",
"challengeStoryDesc898":"But... master, we uh...",
"challengeStoryDesc899":"[The dumb guard pisses Zhao An off.]",
"challengeStoryDesc900":"I asked you to go away! Do you want to keep your job or not? I don't pay for fools!",
"challengeStoryDesc901":"[The team disbands after they see Zhao An get worked up.]",
"challengeStoryDesc902":"[Prince Baylor looks around the messy mansion and its two owners with a scowl.]",
"challengeStoryDesc903":"Zhao An, as a high-ranking official, both your son and your staff are undisciplined.",
"challengeStoryDesc904":"You really are unworthy of the official uniform on you. I bet His Majesty would be disappointed.",
"challengeStoryDesc905":"[Zhao An simpers in embarrassment but dares not to show any disrespect for Prince Baylor's lecture.]",
"challengeStoryDesc906":"Right, right, right. From now on, I'll strictly discipline my son and regulate my people. It won't happen again.",
"challengeStoryDesc907":"My son is ignorant, but it was an inadvertent mistake. Your Honors, could you please punish him leniently? Perhaps...",
"challengeStoryDesc908":"Dad, who are these people? Why can they get away with offending our family?",
"challengeStoryDesc909":"[Before Zhao An finishes talking, his son cuts him off.]",
"challengeStoryDesc910":"And why are you so humble before them? You put Zhao family and our ancestors to shame!",
"challengeStoryDesc911":"Shut up, you failure!!!",
"challengeStoryDesc912":"[Zhao An is so angry that he can't help shaking.]",
"challengeStoryDesc913":"Won't you shut up! It's you who have put Zhao family and our ancestors to shame! Woe is me!",
"challengeStoryDesc914":"[You and your fellows sigh and shake heads to this farce. Finally, you speak.]",
"challengeStoryDesc915":"Zhao Kang, you are just incorrigible, aren't you?",
"challengeStoryDesc916":"Hundreds of years ago when your forefather, the major general of the time, built up your family, Zhao was supposed to be an honorable surname but now... The only thing you've inherited from your ancestors is audacity.",
"challengeStoryDesc917":"But you...",
"challengeStoryDesc918":"[Zhao Kang, infuriated, grabs a sword a guard left on the ground.]",
"challengeStoryDesc919":"You are but an idle rambler! You insult not only me, but also my father and my ancestors! My father can put with the humiliation, it doesn't mean I can!",
"challengeStoryDesc920":"Today, on behalf of my father, I shall teach you how to respect authority!",
"challengeStoryDesc921":"[After Zhao Kang is defeated, you have him under the soldiers' control. However, the Gold Bucket is still obstinate.]",
"challengeStoryDesc922":"Dad! I'm your son! How can you allow them to arrest an official without a warrant?",
"challengeStoryDesc923":"It's against the laws!",
"challengeStoryDesc924":"[You can't help but chuckle at Zhao Kang's sophistry.]",
"challengeStoryDesc925":"Lord Zhao, it looks like your son isn't aware of his fault. He still thinks that we are a bunch of punks here to make trouble.",
"challengeStoryDesc926":"Zhao Kang, your father is higher than me, so here's my advice, whether as an individual or an official, self-knowledge comes first, Second, great observation skill.",
"challengeStoryDesc927":"[Prince Baylor nods while listening to your word like he's pondering something.]",
"challengeStoryDesc928":"Well put, our First Talent. You are indeed erudite. You uttered the method of life and being an official concisely but precisely.",
"challengeStoryDesc929":"Zhao An, you spoil your son and lack management skills. You really are unworthy of your title. Will you admit your misconduct?",
"challengeStoryDesc930":"[Zhao An isn't upset about his son being arrested but he's distressed as a parent.]",
"challengeStoryDesc931":"I'm sure my son must have committed a felony, otherwise, you wouldn't come here in person.",
"challengeStoryDesc932":"But as a father, I still love my boy, so please tell us, what crime did he commit?",
"challengeStoryDesc933":"[Zhao Kang gets nervous after his father says so.]",
"challengeStoryDesc934":"Dad, you know who I am! How could I ever commit any crimes?",
"challengeStoryDesc935":"Just chuck them out! Don't let them alienate us!",
"challengeStoryDesc936":"[Eyes slowly closed, it seems Zhao An can't bear to hear his son's pleas anymore.]",
"challengeStoryDesc937":"[Since his dad doesn't do anything, Zhao Kang turns to his confidential butler for endorsement.]",
"challengeStoryDesc938":"What do you say? Do you think I'm guilty too?",
"challengeStoryDesc939":"No... You have been wronged!",
"challengeStoryDesc940":"[Zhao An berates the butler.]",
"challengeStoryDesc941":"Silence! I'm talking to these lords here! Who gave you the permission to speak!",
"challengeStoryDesc942":"Servants, 50 canings for this mannerless butler! And then kick him out of my house!",
"challengeStoryDesc943":"[After punishing the butler, Zhao An is mentally and physically exhausted. He feels too ashamed to face you.]",
"challengeStoryDesc944":"Good lords, sorry. I really did a terrible job raising my son and managing my people.",
"challengeStoryDesc945":"But Zhao Kang is my only child and I got him at a rather old age. I did spoil him but I never thought he would be so fatuous. I'm very much disappointed.",
"challengeStoryDesc946":"[Zhao An's exhaustion on his face somehow touches you. You feel bad for him because you can't help but remember your own parents who died at early ages.]",
"challengeStoryDesc947":"Parental love is the greatest in the world. People always want the best for their kids, rich or poor. Don't blame yourself too hard.",
"challengeStoryDesc948":"[Zhao An feels relieved and sighs after you comfort him.]",
"challengeStoryDesc949":"My son is mischievous and he often gives me headaches. Look at you, First Talent, your parents are surely gratified to have a successful and well-behaved son like you.",
"challengeStoryDesc950":"You are overrating me but the thing your son did is bigger than a domestic matter.",
"challengeStoryDesc951":"[Zhao An is terrified by what you said.]",
"challengeStoryDesc952":"W-why? Please tell me, what on earth did he do?",
"challengeStoryDesc953":"Lord Zhao, do you know that your son extorted Mayor of Kunshan County?",
"challengeStoryDesc954":"[Zhao An seems dubious about this matter.]",
"challengeStoryDesc955":"I... I believe there must be some sort of misunderstanding. My son said they were good friends and the money was merely a friendly gift...",
"challengeStoryDesc956":"[Looking at Zhao An's confused face, you are astounded by Zhao Kang's brassy lies.]",
"challengeStoryDesc957":"Then how much do you know about the temple?",
"challengeStoryDesc958":"[The moment you finish talking, an arrow flies at you.]",
"challengeStoryDesc959":"Watch out! Assassin!",
"challengeStoryDesc960":"[You defeat the assassin but during the fierce combat, the assassin is badly wounded.]",
"challengeStoryDesc961":"My lord, sorry that I hurt him too hard.",
"challengeStoryDesc962":"Alright, alright, we consider that self-defense. Anyway, we are just passing through the town, the local law enforcement is supposed to be responsible for the case. Mr. Su, I'll leave it to you.",
"challengeStoryDesc963":"[Su Qi'er takes the order. As soon as he's about to take the injured assassin to the medic, a token falls out of his clothes.]",
"challengeStoryDesc964":"[You pick it up and read the words: Bodyguard of Zhao.]",
"challengeStoryDesc965":"[You throw the token to the Zhaos and want an explanation.]",
"challengeStoryDesc966":"Very shrewd of you. Now, how do you explain the assassination and this token?",
"challengeStoryDesc967":"Uh... My son did have a bodyguard but... That person was fired after he offended me once. He's now serving another family.",
"challengeStoryDesc968":"I take full responsibility. My master has nothing to do with my behavior!",
"challengeStoryDesc969":"So... It looks like more people are related to the construction of the temple. They want me dead and then to impute the murder to the Zhaos.",
"challengeStoryDesc970":"[Prince Baylor admires your speculation.]",
"challengeStoryDesc971":"This case is bigger than we expected, we must review it in detail.",
"challengeStoryDesc972":"Zhao Kang, a RANK 8 magistrate, insisted on building a temple despite the disappointing harvest of this year.",
"challengeStoryDesc973":"He then forced the folks to turn in money and food in three days, claiming that the temple benefits the people and honors his family! Anyone who refused to obey would be imprisoned.",
"challengeStoryDesc974":"It's an unheard-of enormity!",
"challengeStoryDesc975":"I... I... I just... You sinner!",
"challengeStoryDesc976":"[Zhao An loses the last bit of hope in his eyes after hearing what his son has done. He seems to get ten years older in a minute.]",
"challengeStoryDesc977":"[Zhao Kang, however, still tries to justify himself.]",
"challengeStoryDesc978":"I'm developing the economy!",
"challengeStoryDesc979":"[Zhao An looks more decadent once hears his son blabbing in denial. Even his voice has this old-man quiver.]",
"challengeStoryDesc980":"Shut up! Can't you see what you have done? Why would these gentlemen frame you up?",
"challengeStoryDesc981":"[Zhao An then turns around to kowtow in the direction where Zhao's ancestral temple locates.]",
"challengeStoryDesc982":"I, Zhao An, the fourth master of Zhao family, have spoiled my son Zhao Kang, who now has become a monster that abuses the people. I'm so ashamed to face my ancestors! I'm willing to take 50 canings.",
"challengeStoryDesc983":"[After pleading guilty to the ancestors, he scolds Zhao Kang pointing at the ancestral temple's direction.]",
"challengeStoryDesc984":"How dare you mention our ancestors to me earlier? You can say directly what you have done to them now!",
"challengeStoryDesc985":"[Zhao Kang realizes that his father is genuinely angry. Head lowered, he cowers and dares not to make a sound.]",
"challengeStoryDesc986":"[Zhao An sighs eventually and pleads guilty in front of you again.]",
"challengeStoryDesc987":"I apologize, Your Honors, for making you witness this farce in our family.",
"challengeStoryDesc988":"Like I said, this is bigger than a domestic matter. It's matter of the failure to execute the duty as an official and the harm on the welfare of the people. But trust me, I will accurately and impartially report the case.",
"challengeStoryDesc989":"[Zhao Kang hides behind a guard shaking after hearing the case will be reported to the Imperial Court.]",
"challengeStoryDesc990":"[Zhao An is so mad at his chickenhearted son who was swaggering just a moment ago.]",
"challengeStoryDesc991":"[He picks up a blade a guard left from the ground and attempts to hack his son.]",
"challengeStoryDesc992":"[You hold Zhao An back in a hurry.]",
"challengeStoryDesc993":"Lord Zhao, please don't! Even if Zhao Kang's convicted, as a RANK 8 official, he'll have his trial in the capital. Lynching is forbidden!",
"challengeStoryDesc994":"[Zhao An got carried away but you manage to calm him down.]",
"challengeStoryDesc995":"Lord Zhao, we understand that you want to teach your son a lesson but it is what it is. Solving the problem is more important than punishment. Just wait for the Imperial Court's verdict. Lynching is unauthorized!",
"challengeStoryDesc996":"[Zhao An burst into tears after hearing his son's trial will be held in the capital.]",
"challengeStoryDesc997":"Sorry for being impulsive. Zhao Kang is my only son. Even though he immorally committed a felony but I can't... How can I...",
"challengeStoryDesc998":"Thanks to your timely intervention, I would have made a huge mistake otherwise.",
"challengeStoryDesc999":"[Zhao An finally regains composure. He then quietly drowns himself deep in thought.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1000":"Zhao Kang is my heir, sooner or later, he will inherit the family. If it was reported to the throne, his career would be ruined, as well as our family reputation.",
"challengeStoryDesc1001":"No... I must find a way to keep it from the Imperial Court.",
"challengeStoryDesc1002":"[After deliberation, Zhao An decides to go with the ruse of self-damage.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1003":"You are a letdown! If I don't punish you today, our ancestors cannot even rest in peace!",
"challengeStoryDesc1004":"From this day on, you will no longer be Zhao's heirs! Zhao family cannot be inherited by a malefactor!",
"challengeStoryDesc1005":"[The moment Zhao Kang hears that his right of inheritance is deprived, he screams in panic but Zhao An ignores him.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1006":"Your Honors, I know that my son has committed a felony but every country has laws, so does every family. If I don't punish according to our family rules, our ancestors shall not rest in peace.",
"challengeStoryDesc1007":"Hope you understand.",
"challengeStoryDesc1008":"[Prince Baylor thinks Zhao An has a point so he acquiesces to his decision.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1009":"Guards, cane him 50 times! And then lock him in the detention room! No one is allowed to see him without my permission!",
"challengeStoryDesc1010":"[Guards answer the call but none of them dare to step forward.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1011":"My lord... Why do you punish the young master?",
"challengeStoryDesc1012":"Zhao family doesn't tolerate a sinner! Am I still the master or he is?",
"challengeStoryDesc1013":"If you feel sorry for him, you can lock yourself in the detention room with him!",
"challengeStoryDesc1014":"Guards! Take him and his gang away!",
"challengeStoryDesc1015":"If anyone of you shows any mercy on him, you will be punished with him! I'm old but I can still wield the Iron Rod of Zhao!",
"challengeStoryDesc1016":"[Once the guards hear the Iron Rod of Zhao, everyone zips their lips and submissively take Zhao Kang to the backyard.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1017":"[Shan Ji is curious about why the guards are so afraid of the Iron Rod of Zhao.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1018":"[While Prince Baylor knows these noble family rules quite well, he explains,]",
"challengeStoryDesc1019":"The first generation of Zhao family is one of the founding figures of our dynasty. Our founding emperor personally gifted the meritorious Lord Zhao this very rod.",
"challengeStoryDesc1020":"That was the glory of our ancestors in the past. Now my son proves to be a disappointment, I put my family to shame.",
"challengeStoryDesc1021":"[Not until everything is settled down, does Zhao An realize his family doors are wide open, quite a number of folks have witnessed the whole farce outside.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1022":"Why are you still standing there like idiots! Close the doors!",
"challengeStoryDesc1023":"[Zhao An breathes a sigh of relief after the doors are closed.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1024":"Apologies, my distinguished guests! How about rest in my house for the day. Follow me to the parlor, please.",
"challengeStoryDesc1025":"[Zhao An seems to distrust his servants after what happened.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1026":"Off you go, I will serve these guests myself today.",
"challengeStoryDesc1027":"Your Honors, please sit. These tea leaves are freshly picked days ago. Would you like a taste?",
"challengeStoryDesc1028":"Forgive my cursoriness, please, Your Highness. I should have welcomed you in a more agreeable situation. After my good-for-nothing son made that big trouble, I just can't be sorrier...",
"challengeStoryDesc1029":"[At this moment, Su Qi'er hears something outside the window and he dashes out of the room.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1030":"Hey, who's sneaking around there!",
"challengeStoryDesc1031":"[Soon, Su Qi'er returns in disappointment.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1032":"My lord, sorry that the eavesdropper escaped but he dressed like an accountant to me.",
"challengeStoryDesc1033":"Mr. Su, don't worry about it. I don't think he would be someone important.",
"challengeStoryDesc1034":"[When Su Qi'er stands behind you again, you decide to discuss with Prince Baylor and Zhao An how to deal with Zhao Kang.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1035":"Prince Baylor, Lord Zhao, what should we do about Zhao Kang?",
"challengeStoryDesc1036":"[Zhao An gets alarmed, he bows to Prince Baylor and says preemptively,]",
"challengeStoryDesc1037":"Your Honors, although I have brought up a sinner, still, he's my only child, could you please sentence him leniently.",
"challengeStoryDesc1038":"We understand. However, the law is the law. If we take the liberty to cut him some slack after what he's done, how can we face Yangzhou civilians?",
"challengeStoryDesc1039":"Sir Pang, this is the emperor's childhood study pal begging... Please?",
"challengeStoryDesc1040":"Lord Zhao...",
"challengeStoryDesc1041":"Alright, Say no more, both of you. Indeed, Zhao Kang is a malefactor but since Lord Zhao pleads, how about we let His Majesty decide during the South Tour?",
"challengeStoryDesc1042":"Thank you, Your Highness.",
"challengeStoryDesc1043":"As you wish, Your Highness.",
"challengeStoryDesc1044":"The South Tour is important. We are here to pre-check the route incognito so as to survey the people's conditions. Call me Pang Jian in public in the future!",
"challengeStoryDesc1045":"Understood.",
"challengeStoryDesc1046":"Lord Zhao, there's another thing I've been meaning to discuss with you.",
"challengeStoryDesc1047":"Just be straightforward with me, I will do whatever I can.",
"challengeStoryDesc1048":"I appreciate it. Of all the people I observed earlier, the assassin and those household guards seemed rather questionable. If we were to find out the mastermind, I think we might as well start with your guards.",
"challengeStoryDesc1049":"[Shan Ji and Su Qi'er take the soldiers to question Zhao's guards one by one, many of them are indeed duplicitous spies.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1050":"Your house is safe now, to some degree. I honestly don't know how you managed your people previously... And how did you sleep at night with these spies around you...",
"challengeStoryDesc1051":"[Shan Ji's sarcasm makes Zhao An nervous and embarrassed.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1052":"I... I... How blind of me! How careless of me!",
"challengeStoryDesc1053":"People say “domestic management comes before nationwide governance“. You are really unworthy of your rank since an outsider is more worried about your family affairs than you are.",
"challengeStoryDesc1054":"[After hearing Prince Baylor's lecture, Zhao An drops the teacup on to the ground and kneels down in fear. Uniform soaked, Lord Zhao looks utterly ludicrous.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1055":"Pri... Sir Pang, I've learned this lifelong lesson, I will be strict moving forward, showing zero tolerance to dishonesty!",
"challengeStoryDesc1056":"[Prince Baylor acquiesces to Zhao An's sincere repentance.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1057":"Glad to hear, however...",
"challengeStoryDesc1058":"With such loose safeguard, His Majesty stayed in your mansion during multiple South Tours. It really horrifies me now that I think about it.",
"challengeStoryDesc1059":"I suppose you have known this year's route. After what I have experienced, I won't allow your mansion to be the midway stop anymore.",
"challengeStoryDesc1060":"Yet Yangzhou is your city, please help find another safe place for His Majesty to stay, Lord Zhao. What do you think?",
"challengeStoryDesc1061":"Yes, yes, very true. Above all, we must ensure His Majesty's safety.",
"challengeStoryDesc1062":"We'd like your household guards to be under military administration, if possible, to further safeguard His Majesty's stay.",
"challengeStoryDesc1063":"Sure thing. Very thoughtful of you, sir. Just command my people however you want, commanders.",
"challengeStoryDesc1064":"Please be generous with your advice. You and I shall secure the South Tour together.",
"challengeStoryDesc1065":"[You hear a commotion outside Zhao's mansion, Su Qi'er goes to check it out under your order.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1066":"[Soon, he returns.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1067":"What's going on out there, Mr. Su?",
"challengeStoryDesc1068":"Nothing big, but a bunch of hooligans hired to beat poor people by Zhao Kang came over to make trouble. Because they didn't get paid.",
"challengeStoryDesc1069":"[Prince Baylor frowns after hearing it.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1070":"The Zhaos are officials, how can you allow your son to work with ruffians to harm the poor? Yes, you didn't know but still, it's a crime of connivance.",
"challengeStoryDesc1071":"Yes, yes, I'm guilty. During the South Tour, I will personally take my son to plead guilty before His Majesty.",
"challengeStoryDesc1072":"[You still have a feeling that Zhao An is trying to muddle it through so you enjoin him once more.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1073":"Lord Zhao, the South Tour is too important to be slurred over. First of all, keep a low profile, secondly, keep a serious attitude. Hope you can keep the two things in mind.",
"challengeStoryDesc1074":"It's late now. Since Zhao Kang has been dealt with, we'd better leave.",
"challengeStoryDesc1075":"You are a smart man, Lord Zhao, please watch your son closely. If he disappears before the South Tour...",
"challengeStoryDesc1076":"His Majesty will adjudicate himself.",
"challengeStoryDesc1077":"Sure... Sure thing. Trust me, I won't have the nerve to play tricks under your watch.",
"challengeStoryDesc1078":"It's dinner time, Your Honors, I've asked the kitchen to cook Yangzhou specialties for you. Won't you give them a try?",
"challengeStoryDesc1079":"Thanks but no. We've got other business to attend to tomorrow so we'll head back to the posthouse now. We'll visit again in a few days to discuss the South Tour arrangement with you.",
"challengeStoryDesc1080":"[You choose not to linger in Zhao's mansion. When you pass a dark alley on your way back to the posthouse, a bunch of ruffians surrounds you.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1081":"Chief, I saw them walking out of Zhao's mansion just now.",
"challengeStoryDesc1082":"They must be the Gold Bucket's friends. Look at them, all dressed in fancy clothes. I bet we can squeeze quite a lot from them!",
"challengeStoryDesc1083":"Boys, attack! Keep them alive though!",
"challengeStoryDesc1084":"[With Shan Ji and Su Qi'er's help, you get rid of the ruffians. While Zhao's mansion is in a fluster.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1085":"Don't know how's my boy doing? I gotta find a chance to see him.",
"challengeStoryDesc1086":"Butler, go and check if those people are actually gone.",
"challengeStoryDesc1087":"[Soon, the butler trots into the parlor while Zhao An walks round and round restlessly.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1088":"My lord, they're long gone. I'm sure they won't be back in a short time.",
"challengeStoryDesc1089":"Great, ask the kitchen to prepare some nice wine and food and visit my boy with me.",
"challengeStoryDesc1090":"Yes. Master.",
"challengeStoryDesc1091":"[A while later, Zhao An and the butler reach the detention room, they can hear Zhao Kang's whines and moans through the door. Zhao An pushes the door open and says,]",
"challengeStoryDesc1092":"My poor son, I'm here for you. These are your favorite dishes, come on, have some.",
"challengeStoryDesc1093":"[Zhao Kang is still mad at Zhao An, he whacks the dishes to the ground.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1094":"No! Dad, what were you thinking? Why do you lock me up in here?",
"challengeStoryDesc1095":"Calm down, my boy. I'll explain.",
"challengeStoryDesc1096":"[Zhao An tells your identities and what happened afterward to Zhao Kang.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1097":"My boy, now you know why I lock you up in the detention room? I don't want to but I must!",
"challengeStoryDesc1098":"But dad, how long do I have to be locked up in here for?",
"challengeStoryDesc1099":"You have to stay in jail for a little longer. When this matter quiets down, I will let you out, otherwise, it would only escalate.",
"challengeStoryDesc1100":"[Unaware of being bugged by you, the Zhaos are scheming in the detention room.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1101":"[The spy rushes back to report to you shortly after you return to the posthouse.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1102":"My lord, Zhao An went to visit his son in the detention room. According to their scheme, Zhao Kang will be released after the South Tour.",
"challengeStoryDesc1103":"This is it then. What do you think, gentlemen?",
"challengeStoryDesc1104":"Sir, this thing is complicated, we may as well play along.",
"challengeStoryDesc1105":"Do elaborate.",
"challengeStoryDesc1106":"Since Zhao An played the ruse of self-damage, why don't we advertise it for him? To show how selfless he is to the civilians.",
"challengeStoryDesc1107":"Great idea. Let's do as Mr. Ji suggests.",
"challengeStoryDesc1108":"Spread the news tomorrow, make sure that everyone knows Zhao Kang is in detention.",
"challengeStoryDesc1109":"Yes.",
"challengeStoryDesc1110":"Beware though, don't expose your identities.",
"challengeStoryDesc1111":"[The next day, the teahouse is packed with people. Surrounded by the audience here to listen to the gossips around Yangzhou, the teahouse tender is talking and mimicking in excitement.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1112":"Tell you what, when I went to Yangzhou for replenishment that day, I saw something big!",
"challengeStoryDesc1113":"Do you know that Zhao Kang the Gold Bucket, son of Zhao An, the Magistrate of Yangzhou? Also, a villain, a bully...",
"challengeStoryDesc1114":"Anyway, a mysterious gentleman of justice reported his crimes to his father who had no way but to put his son in jail...",
"challengeStoryDesc1115":"[Because Zhao An is in detention, the construction of the temple is terminated, the folks cheer and rejoice.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1116":"Have you heard that the Gold Bucket is locked up? And we can forget about the temple.",
"challengeStoryDesc1117":"Of course I have. Also, I heard a mysterious gentleman denounced him. Thanks to him, we don't need to suffer anymore.",
"challengeStoryDesc1118":"Yeah, yeah, he's a great guy!",
"challengeStoryDesc1119":"[Now that Zhao Kang is in detention, you intend to stroll on the street out of boredom. Before you step out of the porch, a bunch of men in black surrounds you.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1120":"Watch out!",
"challengeStoryDesc1121":"Who are you? How dare you assault me in the middle of the day?",
"challengeStoryDesc1122":"Ha, it doesn't matter who we are. What matters is that you have messed with someone you shouldn't have. Don't you think you control Yangzhou now! Kill them, boys!",
"challengeStoryDesc1123":"[After you arrest and interrogate one of them, you learn that he was sent by Yangzhou Aristocrats. Then you acquire complete evidence of the collusion between Zhao Kang and Yangzhou Aristocrats to build the temple.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1124":"These aristocrats don't care about the people whatsoever! After the locust plague, the harvest in Jiangnan was terrible. I'm appalled to hear that these people try to raise the grain price at this point!",
"challengeStoryDesc1125":"I've written a letter to report this to the Imperial Court. I'm sure it'll be settled in no time.",
"challengeStoryDesc1126":"[Shortly after the mayhem in Yangzhou is sorted, Prince Baylor receives a secret message from the Imperial Court.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1127":"A bandit crisis is threatening Hangzhou. What a year of disaster!",
"challengeStoryDesc1128":"His Majesty has given the Imperial Edict that we lead Jiangnan garrison to suppress the riot in Hangzhou.",
"challengeStoryDesc1129":"Please aid me in this crusade.",
"challengeStoryDesc1130":"Sure. It's my honor to serve the throne.",
"challengeStoryDesc1131":"[To prepare for the bandit suppression, you start to collect information about the riot.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1132":"It's important to always know your enemy before battle. My lord, do you know what I have learned?",
"challengeStoryDesc1133":"Come on, out with it.",
"challengeStoryDesc1134":"My lord, do you still remember that Liu Gen who used to be a bandit? The boss of Hangzhou bandits Lin Bao is his godfather.",
"challengeStoryDesc1135":"[After you collect the information on Lin Bao, you decide to set off to Hangzhou.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1136":"[However, someone still needs to be in charge of the preparation for the South Tour in Yangzhou. It's a major event that mustn't go wrong.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1137":"What to do? The bandit suppression is urgent, the South Tour is also important. Could you advise, gentlemen?",
"challengeStoryDesc1138":"[Ji Xiaolan smiles at you with self-assurance.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1139":"Don't wrong, we operate separately. I will see to the trifles here in Yangzhou.",
"challengeStoryDesc1140":"I intend to do so. Well then, thank you and please see the preparation of the South Tour done.",
"challengeStoryDesc1141":"[The next day, you, Shan Ji, Su Qi'er and Prince Baylor bid Ji Xiaolan farewell and travel light to Hangzhou.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1142":"Bandits are rampant on our way to Hangzhou. General Shan, Mr. Su, please protect us.",
"challengeStoryDesc1143":"I'm at your service!",
"challengeStoryDesc1144":"Sir Pang, don't worry, we will convoy you with might and main!",
"challengeStoryDesc1145":"[You begin to discuss how to handle the riot on the way.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1146":"According to the intel, Lin Bao has occupied the hilly area of Jiangnan for many years. Even the Hangzhou authority has been compromised.",
"challengeStoryDesc1147":"I anticipate that there's bound to be a fierce battle during this bandit suppression. But to secure the South Tour, these bandits must be wiped out!",
"challengeStoryDesc1148":"General Shan, any idea from an experienced commander?",
"challengeStoryDesc1149":"As far as I know, Hangzhou army lacks training for ages, and is compromised too. I don't think we can rely on Hangzhou Garrison to win this battle.",
"challengeStoryDesc1150":"First things first, we must dispatch Yangzhou Garrison to Hangzhou.",
"challengeStoryDesc1151":"Yangzhou Garrison is stationed at the end of this road but they only take commands from the Zhaos. I'll need your Token of Authority and personal token to order them, Sir Pang.",
"challengeStoryDesc1152":"It's fine, General Shan, just take them.",
"challengeStoryDesc1153":"[You are stopped by the guards at the entrance of the cantonment.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1154":"Who are you? This is a military-controlled area! You can't walk in without permission!",
"challengeStoryDesc1155":"One more step and I will draw my blade.",
"challengeStoryDesc1156":"You! Take a look at these. By the Imperial Edict, we are here to redeploy Yangzhou Garrison to suppress the bandits in Hangzhou.",
"challengeStoryDesc1157":"[Shan Ji shows the guard the Token of Authority and Baylor's personal token. Whereas the guard throws them back to Shan Ji after toying it in hand.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1158":"We didn't receive the notification of redeployment. If we fell for this fake Token of Authority of yours, we might get in serious trouble.",
"challengeStoryDesc1159":"How dare you! Do you know who this is?",
"challengeStoryDesc1160":"[Su Qi'er is worked up after being provoked, you ask the soldiers to hold him back in a hurry. Yet the guard of Yangzhou Garrison challenges you again.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1161":"I don't care who you are! I wouldn't care if you were the emperor! Only the Token of Zhao can order us!",
"challengeStoryDesc1162":"If you don't have it, get lost already or we won't be so nice to you anymore.",
"challengeStoryDesc1163":"[After defeating the guards, they don't yield, instead, they get more offensive.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1164":"How... How dare you hurt soldiers at a cantonment? You... You wait here!",
"challengeStoryDesc1165":"[Then he runs towards Zhao's mansion instead of into the cantonment.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1166":"[Shan Ji scowls at the guard who's running towards Zhao's mansion.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1167":"Total lack of discipline! These slacking soldiers are good for nothing! They'll need strict training!",
"challengeStoryDesc1168":"[Prince Baylor nods as if he disapproves of the undisciplined Yangzhou Garrison.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1169":"Indeed. The bandit suppression will be perilous. Please properly train and regulate them, General Shan.",
"challengeStoryDesc1170":"[Shan Ji feels quite honored that Prince Baylor trusts and values him more after what happened in Zhao's mansion.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1171":"It's my duty as a commander. Thank you for your recognition. I will see to it.",
"challengeStoryDesc1172":"As a competent general, you are very modest. I will recommend you to His Majesty, General Shan. Do not fail the country, please.",
"challengeStoryDesc1173":"[Shan Ji once again tries to decline, you impede him at once.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1174":"Brother, Sir Pang appreciates your competence, just say thank you.",
"challengeStoryDesc1175":"Uh...",
"challengeStoryDesc1176":"Brother, our top priority is to take the troops of Yangzhou Garrison to Hangzhou as soon as possible. We are counting on you.",
"challengeStoryDesc1177":"[You enter Yangzhou Garrison cantonment. It's supposed to be training hour but no one is at the training ground.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1178":"Unbelievable! These soldiers totally disregard military laws! Mr. Su, get these slackers out for military drills.",
"challengeStoryDesc1179":"Come on, Lord Shan! I intend to do so!",
"challengeStoryDesc1180":"[An hour later, the troops of Yangzhou Garrison finally all gather together at the training ground. Prince Baylor gets on the podium to give the order.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1181":"By the Imperial Edict, with these two royal tokens, here I order Yangzhou Garrison to march to Hangzhou for the bandit suppression. You will be under General Shan's command. All merits you make will be correspondingly rewarded!",
"challengeStoryDesc1182":"[And then, the original commander of Yangzhou Garrison stands out and objects,]",
"challengeStoryDesc1183":"Hold on, why should we believe you! What if the edict is fake? We can't afford to take that risk! Do you have the Token of Zhao with you?",
"challengeStoryDesc1184":"How dare you disrespect the Imperial Edict? Soldiers, take him down for interrogation!",
"challengeStoryDesc1185":"[After your soldiers take this troublemaker down, a new recruit stands out to suggest,]",
"challengeStoryDesc1186":"My... My lords, our commander... He's Lord Zhao's cousin... So could you please just let it go?",
"challengeStoryDesc1187":"Huh? Zhao Kang's cousin? Good, put him in prison, let His Majesty adjudicate himself. I'd like to see who's bigger in Yangzhou, the Zhaos or the emperor?",
"challengeStoryDesc1188":"[Prince Baylor takes out the secret Imperial Edict, all the soldiers suddenly hold still in silence.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1189":"Behold the edict. Zhao Kang is now in hot water himself. Do any of you still have a problem?",
"challengeStoryDesc1190":"No... No... We are all yours to command.",
"challengeStoryDesc1191":"Well then, you will be under General Shan's command. Anyone who disobeys will be punished according to military laws!",
"challengeStoryDesc1192":"YES!SIR!",
"challengeStoryDesc1193":"Troops, listen! Go to your dorms to change into casual clothes, every forty men a team, enter Hangzhou City separately as trade caravans. Do not alert the enemy!",
"challengeStoryDesc1194":"Five days later, you will rally at the north of Hangzhou at noon.",
"challengeStoryDesc1195":"[After traveling the whole day, you've finally arrived at Hangzhou City. The scene of livid houses in rain inside the city touches you.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1196":"I have to quote “Ethereal green hill and hazy fog make the best scene“ to describe this view! Having seen such a dreamlike view in Jiangnan, I shall die without regret.",
"challengeStoryDesc1197":"Too bad, the ancient city with a history of thousands of years is rotting from the inside.",
"challengeStoryDesc1198":"Sorrow no more. We are here to cleanse and pacify the city, aren't we?",
"challengeStoryDesc1199":"Correct! And you are the most important role in this suppression, my brother.",
"challengeStoryDesc1200":"With General Shan's help, we will successfully suppress the bandits and the South Tour will be much securer! It's been a tiring day, we will rest and discuss tomorrow.",
"challengeStoryDesc1201":"[You feel relaxed after you safely reach Hangzhou.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1202":"[But while you are deciding where to stay, a bandit scout spots you.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1203":"Stop! You look like strangers. All the trade caravans passing the city must be reported to Boss Lin! Come with me!",
"challengeStoryDesc1204":"Can't believe the bandits here are so rampant! Do you honestly think our guards are useless? Come on and fight us!",
"challengeStoryDesc1205":"[The bandit is still yelling even though he's subdued.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1206":"This Hangzhou City belongs to our leader Lin Bao! You have to let me go! My people are all nearby!",
"challengeStoryDesc1207":"[You are so shocked about the arrogance of the Hangzhou thief. So you decided to pretend to be a business traveler to investigate it.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1208":"Very sorry. We are businessmen from Beijing. We came to Hangzhou to take the silk. It was a hasty trip. We don't know the rules of Hangzhou City.",
"challengeStoryDesc1209":"Excuse me. Is Lin Bao the locoal offcial of Hangzhou city?",
"challengeStoryDesc1210":"[The thief looked at you and saw that you were indeed dressed in the capital, he let down his guard.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1211":"Local official? Humph! Lin Bao manages the traffic between the city and the city of Hangzhou. Seeing our leader Lin Bao, the locoal official should have to kneel!",
"challengeStoryDesc1212":"Humph! You don't dare to bully! Go! Follow me to meet Lin Bao!",
"challengeStoryDesc1213":"We've spared you today, but your silk must pay at least 40% to Lin Bao!",
"challengeStoryDesc1214":"[This thief came up with a lion's mouth. You didn't expect to see Lin Bao so soon. After thinking for a while, you decided to delay the deployment of the plan.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1215":"We are ordinary businessmen who come to pick up the goods. We have no money. We've been walking for a few days and we are covered with dust now. I'm afraid that it's not proper for us to meet Lin Bao now.",
"challengeStoryDesc1216":"Can you please wait for 6 days? Let us finish taking the silk. Before we leave Hangzhou, we will give 40% of our silk to Lin Bao.",
"challengeStoryDesc1217":"[The thief thought about it and he agreed.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1218":"Six days later, take the silk to the north of the city, Lin Bao will be waiting for you there, but -",
"challengeStoryDesc1219":"If you just want to lie to Lin Bao, you will regret about that!",
"challengeStoryDesc1220":"[You agree with it. It seems that all preparations should have to be done within these six days.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1221":"[At this moment, the voice of other thieves came.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1222":"You are here!",
"challengeStoryDesc1223":"Brothers! Come on! help me! These traders don’t know Lin Bao and dare to beat me! Get them off! Take them to meet Lin Bao!",
"challengeStoryDesc1224":"You... You!! Today I lost you on purpose!",
"challengeStoryDesc1225":"If you can't give silk after six days! We will beat you definitely!",
"challengeStoryDesc1226":"Let's go!",
"challengeStoryDesc1227":"[After the group of thieves left, you can finally enter Hangzhou City and start an investigation about Linbao.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1228":"How can the Hangzhou garrison be so lax? There were no officers and soldiers in charge at the gate of the city.",
"challengeStoryDesc1229":"No. We've just been checked!",
"challengeStoryDesc1230":"[Prince Baylor doubts about that.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1231":"When were we checked? What! You mean that the thieves are...",
"challengeStoryDesc1232":"Indeed... How arrogant the thieves are! The must be related with the garrison of Hang Zhou government.",
"challengeStoryDesc1233":"We should investigate them carefully this time.",
"challengeStoryDesc1234":"[You enter the city and find that people here live a peacefull life. There is no thief in the chaos.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1235":"[The peaceful scene echoes the thieves outside the city, making Hang Zhou city exceptionally unusual.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1236":"[In order to get more news about Hangzhou City, you enter a tea house to hear what other people talk.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1237":"People like talking in tea house. If there are any news in Hang Zhou city, we will hear about it.",
"challengeStoryDesc1238":"[At this time, people talk about the arrest of Zhao Kang in Yangzhou City, and there was a lot of discussion around.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1239":"If the mysterious people came to us and help us to defeat Lin...",
"challengeStoryDesc1240":"Ssssh! You want to die?",
"challengeStoryDesc1241":"[The sky is getting darker, you go to the courier station to take a rest.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1242":"Let's take a break as soon as possible, and we will act again tomorrow.",
"challengeStoryDesc1243":"[At this time, a probe smashed the window paper and stretched in. You took a look at Su Qi'er. He immediately noticed and sneaked out from the window.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1244":"[In a short while, Su Qi'er came back with a spy who is tied.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1245":"Adult, this time Su is fortunate to have no mission.",
"challengeStoryDesc1246":"Thank you, Mr. Su. Have a good rest tonight. There will be a hard work for you tomorrow.",
"challengeStoryDesc1247":"[After Su Qi'er left, you discuss about the spy with Prince Baylor.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1248":"The spy may be related to Lin Bao. He came to investigate us when we arrive the courier station.",
"challengeStoryDesc1249":"What you said is reasonable. I think that the spy is also taking people's money and serving people. We can try him.",
"challengeStoryDesc1250":"[You untied the spy.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1251":"Please take a seat. Relax. Mr. Lin just informed us to send you back to the north of the city before tomorrow morning.",
"challengeStoryDesc1252":"Eh... We just arrived in Hangzhou City. I really don’t know about Mr. Lin. I also hope that you can tell me about him, and it will convenient for us to do somthing in the city.",
"challengeStoryDesc1253":"[Look at your performance and doubts, the spy looks a bit disdain.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1254":"You dared to come to Hangzhou City without any knowledge about Mr. Lin. You are so bold.",
"challengeStoryDesc1255":"Mr. Lin is Official RANK 9. If you offend him, you will die.",
"challengeStoryDesc1256":"Is he actually a government official? !",
"challengeStoryDesc1257":"[You and Prince Baylor were shocked to hear this news, but after careful consideration, the collusion of the official residence and bandit Hangzhou City makes the news reasonable.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1258":"True. The emperor doen't distinguish between the loyalty and the traitor. Mr. Lin wan't resigned to be exiled. He leads a group of bandit to express his loyalty.",
"challengeStoryDesc1259":"[Hearing that, you think of a case that shocked the whole government three years ago.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1260":"Is it about the case of‘Hu Tingran’ three years ago?",
"challengeStoryDesc1261":"Lin Bao named Lin Congzhi before? He has made such a ridiculous story. He reversed the right and the wrong. How ridiculous!",
"challengeStoryDesc1262":"You...you dare disrespect Mr. Lin!",
"challengeStoryDesc1263":"As a loser, don't cry so loud. When the time is ripe, we will let you go.",
"challengeStoryDesc1264":"[At this time, the spy realized that you were fishing for information. He knew that he had made a big mistake, then he lowered his head and stopped talking.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1265":"[After placing the spy in the small room, you and Prince Baylor returned to the room and discussed something about the latest news.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1266":"Is Lin Congzhi still alive? The officers and soldiers who escorted him three years ago reported that he died on the way to exile. Maybe they have been bought by him.",
"challengeStoryDesc1267":"Didn't expect Lin Bao is involved in such an old case. Lin Bao escaped the exile from the death penalty. He is truly a traitor. We should be more careful in this action.",
"challengeStoryDesc1268":"[Prince Baylor seem to have had an intersection with Lin Congzhi three years ago. He indulged in a moment and talked with you about Lin Congzhi in his memory.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1269":"Lin Congzhi has been in the position of appeasement three years ago. He often walks around and manages military affairs. He formed a chain of interests from the military minister to the local officials.",
"challengeStoryDesc1270":"I was studying and preparing the imperial exam at that time. I heard about the case at that time. It sounds so sensational.",
"challengeStoryDesc1271":"At that time, the case was very widespread, and emperor ordered to severely punished the people involved. The case was named Hu Tingran, who is the Minister of Military and the biggest culprit.",
"challengeStoryDesc1272":"What's the final result of the case?",
"challengeStoryDesc1273":"[Prince Baylor looked at you and seemed to be very satisfied with your attitude.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1274":"This is the secret of the court. I will tell you about that. I hope you will not be chilling.",
"challengeStoryDesc1275":"[You know the importance of the Hu Tingran case, and agree with it. Prince Baylor continue to talk.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1276":"Finally, some of the officials were executed, some of the officials were exciled.",
"challengeStoryDesc1277":"But the biggest culprit Hu Tingran was detained for a few days only. Because of insufficient evidence and the force behind him.",
"challengeStoryDesc1278":"[At this time, the window frame slammed.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1279":"Stop! Who is outside? !",
"challengeStoryDesc1280":"[In the early morning of the next day, the bandit of Zhongyi Mountain were gathered in Juyi Hall.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1281":"Mr. Lin, none of the spies sent out last night came back.",
"challengeStoryDesc1282":"What? Who the hell are them, daring to catch my people.",
"challengeStoryDesc1283":"Please cease to be angry, they are the merchants from faraway city, and they have to be blind not to know you.",
"challengeStoryDesc1284":"Indeed. Now they already know you. They must be worrying!",
"challengeStoryDesc1285":"Maybe they are preparing to come to the mountain to plead guilty!",
"challengeStoryDesc1286":"[Their noisy provoked Lin Bao upset.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1287":"[He raised his hand and threw the golden candlestick to the ground and made a loud bang. The world goes quiet for a second.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1288":"Shut up! It’s not the time to be gilb!",
"challengeStoryDesc1289":"Send a few more people down the mountain to investigate them. We should make preparations in advance.",
"challengeStoryDesc1290":"[After half a day, Lin Bao got nasty and decided to take someone to Hangzhou City to investigate by himself.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1291":"Let's go down the mountain with me to the Hangzhou City. It happened that it was time for the girl in Blosson Tavern to receive guest! Go to have fun!",
"challengeStoryDesc1292":"[Standing at the gate of Hangzhou City, remembering the spy who had not returned, Lin Bao called several men at random.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1293":"You guys go to the Courier Station to investigate the businessmen. See if why they dare to buckle my people! I'll take others to have fun in Blossom Tavern.",
"challengeStoryDesc1294":"Yes, sir.",
"challengeStoryDesc1295":"[In front of the station, you stood on the steps, looking at the thieves who surrounded the Courier Station.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1296":"Have you caught our people last night? If yes! Loose him immediately!",
"challengeStoryDesc1297":"Dare to catch Lin Bao's people! You want to die?",
"challengeStoryDesc1298":"You have to let me go! Mr.Lin is in Hangzhou city!",
"challengeStoryDesc1299":"[The thief is still screaming, you pay attention to the information he unintentionally revealed.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1300":"You said that Lin Bao is here in Hangzhou City today? Has he gone down from the mountain?",
"challengeStoryDesc1301":"[The thief thought that you were afraid of the power of Lin Bao, and continued to show off triumphantly.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1302":"If you didn't provoke Lin Bao to be angry, we don't have to be sent to do this chore!",
"challengeStoryDesc1303":"Indeed! They are at Blossom Tavern. We want to see the Beautiful girls here, too! Oh...",
"challengeStoryDesc1304":"[You smile at the same time as Prince Baylor. It takes no effort to find Lin Bao.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1305":"Lin Bao is in the city, let's go and join in the fun?",
"challengeStoryDesc1306":"Just right! You are really my friend!",
"challengeStoryDesc1307":"Lin Bao took his people into the city to have fun, and the Zhongyi Mountain was empty. It was a good time to investigate. Su Qi'er, please go to investigate.",
"challengeStoryDesc1308":"[On the other side, Lin Bao with a large group of thieves hurriedly from the main road of Hangzhou City into the flower street.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1309":"[All people, horse, carriage had to take evasive action.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1310":"[Finally, they stood at the entrance of the Blossom Tavern. The natural gate of the flower building was locked at day]",
"challengeStoryDesc1311":"[Lin Bao looks at the luxurious gold caves of the building, and can’t help but feel proud.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1312":"I will buy the Blossom Tavern for a day today! Come on! Let's have fun!",
"challengeStoryDesc1313":"[Lin Bao threw some gold Ingots squatted on the gate of the Blossom Tavern, and the thieves hurried to pick them.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1314":"Thank you! Long live! Leader Lin!",
"challengeStoryDesc1315":"[At this time, you happened witnessing the chaos. ]",
"challengeStoryDesc1316":"It’s unfortunate that there is such a incompetent official like Lin Bao in Hang Zhou.",
"challengeStoryDesc1317":"[At this moment. A robber in the dark corner noticed you. And said]",
"challengeStoryDesc1318":"Go away! Don't hinder us.",
"challengeStoryDesc1319":"[The door was slammed, and it was overwhelmed. ]",
"challengeStoryDesc1320":"[After a while, the door was opened and a person came out.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1321":"Who yells here. If you are looking for a girl, come back at night!",
"challengeStoryDesc1322":"[The robbers rushed and pushed the procuress away.",
"challengeStoryDesc1323":"Mr. Lin's arrival is the blessing for you. Call your girls out!",
"challengeStoryDesc1324":"Mr. Lin? Mr. Lin of Zhong Yi Mountain?",
"challengeStoryDesc1325":"That's him!",
"challengeStoryDesc1326":"How lucky I am to serve Mr. Lin today.",
"challengeStoryDesc1327":"Don’t talk nonsense. Call your girls out. Mr. Lin wants the best.",
"challengeStoryDesc1328":"Where are the girls? We want girls!",
"challengeStoryDesc1329":"Open the door!",
"challengeStoryDesc1330":"[Procuress is worried.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1331":"Sorry....But....",
"challengeStoryDesc1332":"If you have something to say. Say it. We got loads of money.",
"challengeStoryDesc1333":"It’s just...Last night, the girls were tired and stayed up. They did not get up now.",
"challengeStoryDesc1334":"I'm worried they are tired now, can't serve you well.",
"challengeStoryDesc1335":"What do you mean by can't serve well? Do you mean that we are hard to satisfy?",
"challengeStoryDesc1336":"Mr. Lin. I don't mean it!",
"challengeStoryDesc1337":"No one dares to refuse me in this city. Do you wanna be the first one?",
"challengeStoryDesc1338":"Open the door!",
"challengeStoryDesc1339":"If you don't open the door, we will rush in!",
"challengeStoryDesc1340":"[These robbers are very excited and they shouted loudly! Shan Ji stands foward to protect you and Prince Baylor.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1341":"Be careful!",
"challengeStoryDesc1342":"[The procuress came out and took Lin Bao's arm.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1343":"Mr. Lin. The girls will dress up well and serve you well.",
"challengeStoryDesc1344":"But. The girls just fell asleep. Could you please come back tonight. The girls will only serve you tonight.",
"challengeStoryDesc1345":"[Hearing procuress' refusal. Lin Bao is very unhappy.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1346":"[Lin Bao slapped procuress so badly.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1347":"It looks like you want no money or life.",
"challengeStoryDesc1348":"[The rest robbers are shouting at Lin Bao's action.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1349":"They don't value us at all!",
"challengeStoryDesc1350":"How about we break this place and take the girls back!",
"challengeStoryDesc1351":"[The procuress was trembling at what they said. She is very scared.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1352":"Plaese! Please not!",
"challengeStoryDesc1353":"I will call girls out. Please wait a moment. Please!",
"challengeStoryDesc1354":"[She ran very fast to call the girls.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1355":"[You are very shocked at what you saw.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1356":"I did not see Lin Bao was so arrogance and overbearing here!",
"challengeStoryDesc1357":"Maybe we could sneak into the robbers to get some information.",
"challengeStoryDesc1358":"[In a short while, the oprocuress brings the girls back. All the robbers rushed to grab girls.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1359":"[You are about to pretend you are one of them to sneak into the building.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1360":"I don't remember you? Who are you?",
"challengeStoryDesc1361":"[Lin Bao was very satisfied when he walk down the stairs.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1362":"Your girls are good. I'm very happy with them.",
"challengeStoryDesc1363":"[At this time. The doors opened and all the robbers rushed out.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1364":"Stop them. They haven't paid yet!",
"challengeStoryDesc1365":"[Lin Bao is about to walk out of the brothel.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1366":"Who dares to ask me to pay?",
"challengeStoryDesc1367":"You...you...Why don't you pay?",
"challengeStoryDesc1368":"[Lin Bao looked around. Then the Procuress swallowed her throat and carefully walked forward.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1369":"Mr. Lin. Err....",
"challengeStoryDesc1370":"What? You think I should pay?",
"challengeStoryDesc1371":"We are doing small business... The girls cost much. None of the faces are not costing...",
"challengeStoryDesc1372":"Besides... Although we operate a disgrace business. But we run it legally. You have to pay by the law.",
"challengeStoryDesc1373":"Law? Hahahaha. Listen to that. There is someone talks about law in front of me in this city.",
"challengeStoryDesc1374":"Don't you know Lin writes the law in this city.",
"challengeStoryDesc1375":"[They beat the procuress for a while.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1376":"[Lin Bao sits in the chair with cruel smile.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1377":"Tell you what. I am the law in this city. It is honor for your girls to have guests like me.",
"challengeStoryDesc1378":"[You were very angry to see the procuress being beaten.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1379":"Stop! How dare you commit a crime! Who give you right to do such things!",
"challengeStoryDesc1380":"What day is today? First there was someone ask me for money. Then there is a nobody question my behavior.",
"challengeStoryDesc1381":"I'm telling you. I am the RIGHT to do everything I want in this city.",
"challengeStoryDesc1382":"[Lin Bao doesn't even give you a glance.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1383":"I'm tired today. I'll spare your life today.",
"challengeStoryDesc1384":"Come to Zhong Yi mountain if you dare.I will take CARE of you. Hahahahaha.",
"challengeStoryDesc1385":"[Procuress lying on the ground. Cried for the mess the robbers left.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1386":"Are you alright?",
"challengeStoryDesc1387":"Thank you. How poor my girls. They don't even get a penny today.",
"challengeStoryDesc1388":"You could go to the government for your justice.",
"challengeStoryDesc1389":"[Procuress said nothing, just shaking her head constantly.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1390":"No...It is useless. I don't want more robbers here anymore.",
"challengeStoryDesc1391":"[You and Prince Baylor are puzzled. Why it's useless?",
"challengeStoryDesc1392":"Hoa can it be useless? Are you worried that the government don't take it seriously bacause of your job?",
"challengeStoryDesc1393":"No. It's just....just useless....",
"challengeStoryDesc1394":"I don't understand much. Can you please explain?",
"challengeStoryDesc1395":"Who dares reveal him? He must kill us if we tell on him.",
"challengeStoryDesc1396":"[You and the Prince Baylor were furious. You did not expect Lin Bao truely has great power in Hangzhou.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1397":"[At this time, a voice was uploaded from the building.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1398":"Who yells?",
"challengeStoryDesc1399":"[Procuress insists not to report it to the government. You determined to solve the troubles and bring the peaceful life back to the people of Hangzhou. ]",
"challengeStoryDesc1400":"The thief has left. Miss, don't be afraid. Close the door and rest.",
"challengeStoryDesc1401":"Lin Bao has done so many bad things. He should be punished.",
"challengeStoryDesc1402":"[After comforting Procuress, you decided to return to the courier station to wait for Su Qi'er to come back and then consider it.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1403":"Lin Bao’s influence in Hangzhou city is really unbelievable. Even if he used to be a local officials, he's a bandit now, why Hangzhou City officials be so vocal about him.",
"challengeStoryDesc1404":"Indeed. There may be some forces behind him. Wait for Su Qi'er and then consider it.",
"challengeStoryDesc1405":"[You just got back to the courier station and you were stopped by the waitor.",
"challengeStoryDesc1406":"Wait, just after you left, a group of bandits rushed in to turn your luggage, they … they are Mr. Lin's men, we can't stop them.",
"challengeStoryDesc1407":"They are looking for something, but in the end they didn't take anything.",
"challengeStoryDesc1408":"It doesn't matter, anyway, we are just traders, and there must be nothing that Mr. Lin needs.",
"challengeStoryDesc1409":"[You exchange a quick smile with Shan Ji. You have already expected that Lin Bao is sly and suspicious, and will definitely send someone to check the spy.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1410":"[You moved the spy to the old temple in the south of the city before going out. You are not afraid of Lin Bao.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1411":"That's fine... That's fine…",
"challengeStoryDesc1412":"[The man seems to be a little shocked, nodded again and again, after a while, he remembered that there are more important things to tell you.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1413":"Oh, one more thing. Another caravan from Yangzhou said that thy know you. They are being stopped by the soldiers outside the city.",
"challengeStoryDesc1414":"[You know that this is the first batch of Yangzhou garrisons that have been disguised. You feel very happy.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1415":"Oh! That is my cousin who is doing silk business in Yang Zhou. I will pick him up!",
"challengeStoryDesc1416":"Be careful. Don't get into trouble with Lin Bao again!",
"challengeStoryDesc1417":"[At the same time, Su Qi'er has been lurking in Zhongyi Mountain for a long time.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1418":"It’s been a long time, there is no one on Zhongyi Mountain. Did Linbao take all the thieves down the mountain, right?",
"challengeStoryDesc1419":"No, I can't leave right now. I have to go to the cottage to find him.",
"challengeStoryDesc1420":"[Su Qi'er walked along the mountain road for a long time. At the door of Juyi Hall, he saw two thieves chatting.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1421":"Our leader Lin has gone to play with other brothers. Why he didn't bring us to player? Who dare to come to our mountain to make trouble?",
"challengeStoryDesc1422":"You are stupid! That's because leader Lin believe us! It's our responsibility to guard here!",
"challengeStoryDesc1423":"But...the letter is just a small note. It can't be important for us to carefully escort this thing...",
"challengeStoryDesc1424":"[The thief is still chatting, but Su Qi'er is keenly aware of the unusual part of their chatting.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1425":"Letter... Careful escort... Responsibility... Zhongyi Mountain is really extraordinary. I really have to look into it.",
"challengeStoryDesc1426":"[Su Qi'er went into the Juyi Hall from the window and went into Lin Bao’s bedroom quietly.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1427":"[Su Qi'er carefully knocked through every inch of the wall and finally found a hole in the back of the bookshelf.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1428":"There is a secret room! I would like to see what secret Lin Bao has!",
"challengeStoryDesc1429":"[Su Qi'er carefully covered the door of the secret room and walked down the stairs.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1430":"[It is a small room with several braziers. Su Shi went over and found that there were a few pieces of paper shards of letters in the brazier. He picked up and carefully read them.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1431":"The court... the secret edict... Prince Yong... Siege... Keep it low profile... Hu…",
"challengeStoryDesc1432":"[Su Qi'er believed that this is the warning letter that Hu Tingran sent to Lin Bao.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1433":"[Su Qi'er knows the importance of this letter and put them into his pocket.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1434":"[At this time, a sound came from outside the door that was not completely closed.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1435":"Eh? Look, I think Leader Lin’s bookshelf moved forward.",
"challengeStoryDesc1436":"[Su Qi'er heard the sound, rushed to the door, waiting for an opportunity to attack them.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1437":"[In Courier station, you are discussing with the leader of the Yang Zhou garrison, and heard knocking at the door.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1438":"Relax. It's must be Su Qi'er.",
"challengeStoryDesc1439":"My Lord, I've found something.",
"challengeStoryDesc1440":"You went deep into the tiger's den to seek information, it was really hard!",
"challengeStoryDesc1441":"What did you found?",
"challengeStoryDesc1442":"Look at this.",
"challengeStoryDesc1443":"[Su Qi'er took the broken letter from his pocket.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1444":"This time, I sneaked into Lin Bao’s bedroom and found a broken letter in the secret room.",
"challengeStoryDesc1445":"This is a letter from Hu Tingran to Lin Bao. Lin Bao is actually a chess that Hu Tingran inserted in Hang Zhou.",
"challengeStoryDesc1446":"I didn’t expect Hu Tingran’s strategy.",
"challengeStoryDesc1447":"Lin Congzhi pretended to die on his way to exile and change his name to Lin Bao to control officials in Hang Zhou City for Hu Tingran...",
"challengeStoryDesc1448":"As I remembered, on the way to exile three years ago, all officials involved died and even made a sensation.",
"challengeStoryDesc1449":"[Even Prince Baylor is hesitant.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1450":"what do you mean……",
"challengeStoryDesc1451":"True. If the official who [died] in the so-called exile, like Lin Bao...",
"challengeStoryDesc1452":"[Su Qi'er's hand stunned with the hand of the letter, and even Prince Baylor shocked and knocked over the teacup at hand.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1453":"If it’s true... This is not what we can handle...",
"challengeStoryDesc1454":"I wrote a secret report to the emperor to ask for help.",
"challengeStoryDesc1455":"[When the room was in a mess, the sound of Lin Bao suddenly came out of the room.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1456":"Surround this courier station and search one by one!",
"challengeStoryDesc1457":"Yes!",
"challengeStoryDesc1458":"[When heard Lin Bao’s voice, everyone in the room stood up.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1459":"How to do now? Lin Bao took people around the station. If we were discovered by him, it'll be a failure.",
"challengeStoryDesc1460":"[You shake your head and tell everyone not to be worry.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1461":"I am going to stop him for a while. You leave here from back door quietly with the garrison.",
"challengeStoryDesc1462":"Don't panic. Don't make too much noise for Lin Bao to discover.",
"challengeStoryDesc1463":"[Seeing Shan Ji and others left the hall, you made a preparation for a fight with Lin Bao.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1464":"[You pretend to be a normal business man with a slight trembling voice, bowing out and walking out of the door.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1465":"Who... Who is at outside? This... This is the courier station…",
"challengeStoryDesc1466":"[Lin Bao thinks that it’s rare to see someone to stop him.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1467":"How strange! There are some people who do not know me...",
"challengeStoryDesc1468":"What! You! Didn't pay tribute to me when enter the city. Break my happy plan in Blossom Tavern. My brother is still missing!",
"challengeStoryDesc1469":"You dare to hit the muzzle. Come to tie him and bring him back to the mountain.",
"challengeStoryDesc1470":"Wait! Wait! Don't... don't tie … It's misunderstanding!",
"challengeStoryDesc1471":"Oh? Misunderstanding? Don't you think I admits the wrong person?",
"challengeStoryDesc1472":"No, no, no, I'm a villain. I have been studying for ten years but failed the emperial exam. There was a sudden change in the family, and I had to do business to make a living.",
"challengeStoryDesc1473":"About the matter in Blossom Tavern. Please forgive me.",
"challengeStoryDesc1474":"[Lin Bao squinted at you for a moment, only after a long while.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1475":"You don’t dare to fool me! So... hand over my brother!",
"challengeStoryDesc1476":"what? The subordinates of you? I've send out him politely, the station guys are watching!",
"challengeStoryDesc1477":"You don't mind my brother going in and looking for him. Go!",
"challengeStoryDesc1478":"[You know that Yang Zhou garrison has not been able to completely withdraw. You can only keep stopping him.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1479":"This is a private residence! You cannot search!",
"challengeStoryDesc1480":"Moreover... my Yang Zhou cousin just brought me some antique calligraphy and paintings of the former dynasty. If they are broken by you, who can take responsibility?",
"challengeStoryDesc1481":"[Lin Bao knew your intention and believed that things were not simple, and the attitude is harder.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1482":"In this Hangzhou city, I'm the official door of the government, and no one dares to say one word!",
"challengeStoryDesc1483":"You are so obscured, you are doing something bad!",
"challengeStoryDesc1484":"[It is not good. Lin bao has become suspicious and can no longer stop.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1485":"I'm a business man, I can do nothing bad...",
"challengeStoryDesc1486":"Let's go! Search! I can't even let go of a piece of hair!",
"challengeStoryDesc1487":"[The hall door was rudely smashed, and there was no one left inside. Only Prince Baylor sat in the main case and played a porcelain bottle.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1488":"[When you look at him, you know that he has a strategy.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1489":"Who are you! Didn't you see us coming in! Still dare to sit in the main seat, get out of here!",
"challengeStoryDesc1490":"[A thief rushed over and wanted to take Prince Baylor down from the main seat.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1491":"Dangdang",
"challengeStoryDesc1492":"[It is the sound of pulling the porcelain bottle to the ground.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1493":"You... you are a bunch of bandits! What kind of official is! you! Do you know how precious this porcelain bottle is!",
"challengeStoryDesc1494":"This is the celadon used by the royal family! This...",
"challengeStoryDesc1495":"[Prince Baylor looked sorrowful, which even misled Lin Bao.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1496":"Quiet! Be careful! Don't touch anything!",
"challengeStoryDesc1497":"Have you searched elsewhere?",
"challengeStoryDesc1498":"[Lin Bao stood in the courtyard and watched the thief come out of the room one by one, and his face became more and more dignified.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1499":"We've even watched the horses, and saw a few crazy people, did not see our brother.",
"challengeStoryDesc1500":"Humph! You don't dare to tie my brother! Those guys have gone to drink wine? Let's go look for it!",
"challengeStoryDesc1501":"Yes, Sir!",
"challengeStoryDesc1502":"It is said that you want to gift me some silk...",
"challengeStoryDesc1503":"My agreement with the shopkeeper is to pick up the goods after four days...",
"challengeStoryDesc1504":"Five days later, see you in the north of the city. If you forget… I will be a little bit merciless.",
"challengeStoryDesc1505":"[After all the thieves have been evacuated, you inform Shanji and the army of Yangzhou to return.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1506":"Lin came to search by himself. He must doubt something but had no evidence.",
"challengeStoryDesc1507":"Indeed. Keep a low profile now. Wait for the new order five days later.",
"challengeStoryDesc1508":"[When you discuss the countermeasures with Prince Baylor, Shan Ji returned with the garrison.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1509":"[Shan Ji sais thank you once he saw you.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1510":"Thank you, everyone for getting time for us to evacuate!",
"challengeStoryDesc1511":"General Shan Ji led the tribute, and it took a lot of hard work for the squad leader to take the garrison with him!",
"challengeStoryDesc1512":"Brother, now Lin Bao’s situation is clear, but I don’t know what we should do now?",
"challengeStoryDesc1513":"Lin Bao has been mourning his brother. I'm afraid that he will not give up. We have to do some preparations for it in advance.",
"challengeStoryDesc1514":"Um... How about…?",
"challengeStoryDesc1515":"[You think about it for a while, and finally feel that this method is too risky, it would be better to return the spy to him to avoid the trouble in the future.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1516":"Brother, please throw him into the Blossom Tavern. With Lin bao’s suspicious temper, if the spy wants to live, he will not speak much.",
"challengeStoryDesc1517":"You are really talented. I'll do it right now!",
"challengeStoryDesc1518":"[At night, Shan Ji got the spy drunk, and gave him to the procuress.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1519":"[The next day, the guys in the Courier station are chatting in the courtyard early in the morning.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1520":"Hey! You heard that there was no, last night spent a full house to drive a drunken person out, saying that it was two nights, and now that person has no money.",
"challengeStoryDesc1521":"Uh... Being with the Beautiful girls is really great, even though it will die.",
"challengeStoryDesc1522":"Hey, sssh! I heard that he was under command of Mr. Lin!",
"challengeStoryDesc1523":"[You are convinced that the plan to let go of the spy has been successful. You think Lin Bao will not come back for a while.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1524":"[Sure enough, after an hour, Su Qi'er who was sent to investigate the situation, returned to tell you a good news.",
"challengeStoryDesc1525":"You excellency, Linbao took the spy back. He said that he would swear to the brothers and make a celebration feast and will not come to Hangzhou city again in these days!",
"challengeStoryDesc1526":"Very good! If the Lin Bao won't come, we can walk around in Hangzhou city to ask about the lives of the people.",
"challengeStoryDesc1527":"So, to save time, we split up. General Shan Ji, you must focus on investigating the infantry dispatch situation in the north of the city.",
"challengeStoryDesc1528":"Understood!",
"challengeStoryDesc1529":"[At noon, there is no empty street in Dongcheng. When you pass a broken restaurant, you are suddenly stopped by an old voice.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1530":"Wait a moment please!",
"challengeStoryDesc1531":"[You look around, and in the dark corner, found an old man leaning against the wall, wearing an old businessman suit.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1532":"[You believe that he needs some help and ask him about it.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1533":"Do you need any help?",
"challengeStoryDesc1534":"[He shooks his head hard, but did not say anything.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1535":"[He seems to live a hard life. You want to ask him something, but suddenly, a loud voice came.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1536":"Old man! Why haven’t you closed this store? This shop belongs to Mr. Lin! Also! Your daughter is not in Hangzhou City! She has been bought by Mr. Lin and enjoys her life now!",
"challengeStoryDesc1537":"Go away! Don't taint the restaurant of Mr. Lin!",
"challengeStoryDesc1538":"[The officers came over and tried to drive away the old man. You stood in front of him to protect him.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1539":"[The old man seems to be unwilling to argue with the officers, and hurriedly took you to the alley.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1540":"Come! Hurry! Hurry! Don't be caught by the officers and men!",
"challengeStoryDesc1541":"Ok... well... Be careful! Mind you don't fall!",
"challengeStoryDesc1542":"[You ran for a long time with the old man, and finally stopped in a ruined thatched cottage.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1543":"Where are we now?",
"challengeStoryDesc1544":"This is my home, a little bit broken. Come in if you don't mind. I will tell you something.",
"challengeStoryDesc1545":"[When you go in and sit down, He give you a glass of white water, but you are more and more confused.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1546":"What is your intention? What can I do for you?",
"challengeStoryDesc1547":"It’s a long story. I saw you quarreling with Lin Bao for a girl in the front door of Blossom Tavern. It’s...",
"challengeStoryDesc1548":"[He said that in a flood of tear.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1549":"Don't worry! Say it slowly!",
"challengeStoryDesc1550":"Uh... My restaurant and poor daughter were caught by Lin bao, but at that time there was no such a nice person like you to help me…",
"challengeStoryDesc1551":"[What he said shocked you.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1552":"Lin Bao caught your daughter?",
"challengeStoryDesc1553":"Uh... Ten years ago, I lost my daugter in a flood. Then, I went to the north. Now I am old, I went back to Hangzhou city to open a small restaurant. I did not expect to see my daughter again here.",
"challengeStoryDesc1554":"But my poor daughter, who had already entered the Blossom Tavern at that time, was caught by Linbao to be his concubine.",
"challengeStoryDesc1555":"Lin Bao is so wicked. My ... my small restaurant was deceived by Lin Bao, and my leg was beaten by his men. It can be said that no one in Hangzhou City can get him, I... I want to ask you for help…",
"challengeStoryDesc1556":"[The old man whispered.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1557":"[When you just wanted to speak, the voice of the soldier came from outside.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1558":"A scorpion runs quite fast!",
"challengeStoryDesc1559":"[The soldiers turned and left. They seems to want to go back and bring more people.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1560":"[Before leaving, they said something bad.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1561":"You... you are courageous, dare to attack soldiers!",
"challengeStoryDesc1562":"[You wanted to go out and chase the soldier, but they were stopped by the old man.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1563":"Old man: [Lin Bao dispatch them to hit me. I was eager to save my daughter and angered Lin Bao. Then, Lin Bao sent someone to smash my house and my restaurant.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1564":"You: [Lin bao is bad, doing many bad things!]",
"challengeStoryDesc1565":"You: [Please be relieved. Lin Bao can not do that any more.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1566":"[The old man is trying to stop you with his eyes flustered.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1567":"Old man: [No, don't bring youself in this matter. Lin Bao has a huge influence here!]",
"challengeStoryDesc1568":"Old Man: [I... I want to know my daughter, my poor daughter, I don't know how much suffering she's facing on the Zhongyi Mountain.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1569":"[Seeing him in tears, you have to guarantee him as the secret of the court.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1570":"You: [Actually, I am the secret of the imperial court. We came to Hangzhou to investigate this case. Please tell me all about Lin Bao. We will bring back justice.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1571":"Old man: [I beg you to save my daughter, save Hangzhou people!]",
"challengeStoryDesc1572":"Old man: [People in Hangzhou City have been living a fearful life for 3 years. The officers and soldiers are under command of Lin Bao. If we don't give him enough money, we will get a punch and kick!]",
"challengeStoryDesc1573":"You: [OK. On behalf of the imperial court, I will surely bring him to justice!]",
"challengeStoryDesc1574":"[There is a burst of snoring outside the house when you are comforting the old man. You rush out to guard the old man in front of the door.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1575":"Soldiers: [It's there! That guy should haven't left yet!]",
"challengeStoryDesc1576":"Soldiers: [Come on! Let him know that who's the leader of Hangzhou city!]",
"challengeStoryDesc1577":"[You force back the minions of Lin Bao and hurries back to the Post, indignant. Everyone is worried to see you like this.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1578":"[Your anger can be well seen from between the eyebrows.] A cup of tea first? The Westlake Longjing has long been a tribute tea.",
"challengeStoryDesc1579":"Thank you very much.",
"challengeStoryDesc1580":"Your Highness, you don't look good. Any big news?",
"challengeStoryDesc1581":"Well, Mr. Su, I will tell.",
"challengeStoryDesc1582":"[You walk to the window, close it and confirms the absence of the scout sent by Lin Bao before you returns to the seat. Then you proceed.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1583":"Today at the entrance to East Street, I met this old owner whose family got trampled on by Lin Bao and the troops in collusion.",
"challengeStoryDesc1584":"[Everyone shakes head in sighs upon hearing what happened to the old owner.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1585":"How inhumane of Lin Bao, to go that far!",
"challengeStoryDesc1586":"[You nod in complete agreement with what Su Qi'er said.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1587":"Right, Mr. Su. Such a merciless and inhumane bastard, we can't have him cause trouble to the commonalty. As soon as the Yangzhou Army arrives, we'll burn down Mount Zhongyi to the ground and wipe out the eyesore of the court!",
"challengeStoryDesc1588":"Your righteousness has my admiration!",
"challengeStoryDesc1589":"I'm flattered, Prince Baylor. It's only that the suppression can't wait. I wonder whether the girl taken by Lin Bao is okay or not...",
"challengeStoryDesc1590":"[Shan Ji breaks into the door when you are discussing with the crowd the details of the suppression operation.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1591":"Brother! Great to have you back. How's the deployment in the villa of the North City.",
"challengeStoryDesc1592":"Worry not, brother! I've ordered the Yangzhou Garrison Troop to excavate a secret tunnel from the villa to the outside of the city. It's a short distance, which will take one or two days.",
"challengeStoryDesc1593":"That's great! So new batches of soldiers will enter the city via the secret tunnel, lest the enemy should be alarmed and the plan disrupted.",
"challengeStoryDesc1594":"If all goes well, we will be able to bring the rebel into justice three days later!",
"challengeStoryDesc1595":"[During the heated discussion, Shan Ji put on a stern look, signaling the crowd to quiet down.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1596":"Someone's coming here.",
"challengeStoryDesc1597":"[It is not long before the door is pushed open. There appears the staff from the Post, gasping and sweating heavily.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1598":"With all due respect, there...there comes this man from Yangzhou, followed by a group of subordinates of Mr. Lin. The man yells for your help. And I can't stop him.",
"challengeStoryDesc1599":"[You feel somewhat confused upon hearing that someone from Yangzhou is here for you. Meanwhile, you worry about anything should happen to the Yangzhou Garrison Troop. You decide to pretend it is a pleasant surprise. ]",
"challengeStoryDesc1600":"He could be my cousin! Is he here in Hangzhou as well? Let's check it out.",
"challengeStoryDesc1601":"[When the man from Yangzhou shows up in front you, you are surprised to find that the man is Zhao An!]",
"challengeStoryDesc1602":"It's you! Why are you here?",
"challengeStoryDesc1603":"I'll explain later! Your Highness! Your Highness! You gotta save me! Those bastards want me dead!",
"challengeStoryDesc1604":"[After you drive away the bandits, you keep the doors and windows shut. Then Zhao An knees down to the ground and kowtows.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1605":"[Thank you for saving me life, Prince Baylor, Top Talent and Commander Shan! This debt, I can't repay it even with my life. From now on, I, Zhao An, is at your service.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1606":"If you want to repay the debt, you may as well rein in your nephew and work diligently for the court. It's the best thing you can do.",
"challengeStoryDesc1607":"Let us get back to that later. You are supposed to garrison Yangzhou, aren't you? And you even are pursued by Lin Bao's minions. No one may disrupt the plan, let alone you!",
"challengeStoryDesc1608":"Mr. Su has a point there. Given your important rank in the court, how can you leave your post?",
"challengeStoryDesc1609":"To be honest, I come here to send one message, hoping that I can make up for my mistake. It is my wish that you will pardon me with your magnanimity. I should've sharpened my eyes to see the sharks in those misunderstandings.",
"challengeStoryDesc1610":"[You make an eye contact with Prince Baylor, feeling that Zhao An might come with a message. You decide to sound out him.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1611":"That you resigned your son to bullying and exploiting the commonalty, I have reported it to His Majesty. Any sentence will be subject to the Majesty's deliberation.",
"challengeStoryDesc1612":"Your Highness, I know I was so wrong! And I'm more than willing to make up for it.",
"challengeStoryDesc1613":"Well...If you do your bit in the purge operation, you may well earn mercy from His Majesty, for His Majesty has been discriminating in rewards and punishments.",
"challengeStoryDesc1614":"Thank you so much, Prince Baylor! And Top Talent and Commander Shan!",
"challengeStoryDesc1615":"Now, what is your hurry to Hangzhou, so urgent that you leave behind the business in Yangzhou? Anything important that you can make up for your mistake?",
"challengeStoryDesc1616":"[Zhao An doesn't look easy upon hearing your question. Instead, he kowtows once more with greater trepidation.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1617":"Word is that Prince Baylor dispatched over a thousand soldier in Hangzhou as ordered by His Majesty to uproot the bandits here. The way I see it, the operation is not viable.",
"challengeStoryDesc1618":"[Every single one present is stunned by the treacherous words of Zhao An.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1619":"[Amid the silence, you are the first one to collect yourself.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1620":"So you were saying the operation is not viable? If you believe that can save your ass, you may as well wait for the disposal by His Majesty.",
"challengeStoryDesc1621":"[Prince Baylor puts on an unhappy look and knits his eyebrows, indicating the shared thought with yours. Zhao An, trembling, continues with his explanation. ]",
"challengeStoryDesc1622":"Your Highness, I am far from talking nonsense. There are as many as thousands of soldiers in collusion with Lin Bao! Your force of a few thousand soldiers available is vastly outnumbered. And a forced attack will do you no good.",
"challengeStoryDesc1623":"[Prince Baylor frowns even more, looking as if he is evaluating the reliability of Zhao An's words.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1624":"[You turn around to Zhao An, trying to collect more information.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1625":"Zhao An, did you confirm the authenticity?",
"challengeStoryDesc1626":"I ain't bold enough to bluff. Lin Bao does have thousands of soldiers.",
"challengeStoryDesc1627":"Thousands? How come? Then the Yangzhou Garrison Troop we dispatched, won't stand a chance...",
"challengeStoryDesc1628":"Your Highness, what we do now?",
"challengeStoryDesc1629":"Don't panic. It remains unknown whether Zhao's telling the truth.",
"challengeStoryDesc1630":"If you don't believe me...Look, the bunch of bandits who followed me here can't be far away. You may as well arrest one and ask!",
"challengeStoryDesc1631":"[Upon hearing Zhao An's sophistic words, Su Qi'er jumps over the window in pursuit of the fleeing bandits, before you even give the order.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1632":"[It doesn't take long before Su Qi'er returns, throwing a tightly-tied bandit onto the ground.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1633":"Thank you, Su Qi'er",
"challengeStoryDesc1634":"Here we are. Now that Zhao An proposed, I feel obliged to have him confront the bandit about that.",
"challengeStoryDesc1635":"Mr. Su, was there any witness when you captured him?",
"challengeStoryDesc1636":"Rest assured, Prince Baylor. The guy was hanging out all alone, trying to extort the merchants in the city whereas his peers have been on the way back to Mount Zhongyi.",
"challengeStoryDesc1637":"However, out there, I did notice quite many subordinates of Lin Bao bribing the soldiers stealthily. The soldiers inside Hangzhou, give or take, have been all bought off by Lin Bao.",
"challengeStoryDesc1638":"Your Highness, how many soldiers have Lin Bao bought off, I will get the answer for you.",
"challengeStoryDesc1639":"[That you didn't even display the slightest fear for Lin Bao gives the bandit creeps. Upon hearing the interrogation, he kowtows for your kind mercy.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1640":"Respectable personages, I got a family to keep. And I was only captivated to follow the bloody guy. I will tell anything you'd like to know if you spare my life!",
"challengeStoryDesc1641":"You are smart. Then tell me, how many men are there in the Mount Zhongyi. And where do they come from?",
"challengeStoryDesc1642":"[The bandit kowtows towards you in gratitude, getting everything off his chest.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1643":"Ever since the bloody Lin arrived at Hangzhou three years ago, peace has been gone. The guy has been flying in defiance of the laws and placing the deep-seated grudges into everyone, by virtue of his connection with the government.",
"challengeStoryDesc1644":"Then why are there so many followers of Lin Bao?",
"challengeStoryDesc1645":"Two years ago, Southern Yangtz Region was stricken with droughts in which everyone starved to death. However, the followers of Lin Bao savored the tastiness of food, which was a powerful spell.",
"challengeStoryDesc1646":"[As the bandit talks about the drought in Southern Yangtze two years ago, you made an eye contact with Prince Baylor, noticing the stern look on his face.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1647":"Two years ago, if I recall correctly, the drought has received the largest fund ever allocated by the court. Did you receive the relief grains or funds?",
"challengeStoryDesc1648":"Your Highness, save that. We commoners didn't see not a single loaf of bread, letting alone the relief fund!",
"challengeStoryDesc1649":"What...what did you say! Have you any idea where the funds were?",
"challengeStoryDesc1650":"Of course in the pocket of the officers. And to curry flavor with Lin Bao, most of the money and grains went to the bloody bastard!",
"challengeStoryDesc1651":"[Up hearing the words, Shan Ji stands up, bashing the table and grasping the scabbard.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1652":"The sins of the Hangzhou officers shall not be forgiven. It's like pushing people into the abyss of crimes! How inhuman is that! I swear to God that I will exterminate the rotters!",
"challengeStoryDesc1653":"Don't, Your Highness! The bastard got a large bunch of minions!",
"challengeStoryDesc1654":"A lot of them are good people. They followed him during the drought with a hope that they could be fed. The bastard got connections in the government in the underworld. Roughly, the force totals to two or three thousand men!",
"challengeStoryDesc1655":"Wait, it's been late. My dudes would come for me. But you may rest assured that I will be your insider and part of the plan!",
"challengeStoryDesc1656":"[The bandit having left the Post, silence hangs over the Meeting Hall. You know clearly that if the bandit was telling the truth, the purge operation might need more consideration.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1657":"[Su Qi'er burst out a hollow laugh to lighten up the mood.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1658":"Everything will work out just fine. We got impartial Prince Baylor, ingenious Top Talent and valiant Commander Shan. There won't be a problem!",
"challengeStoryDesc1659":"[You shake your head, knowing that Su Qi'er was only encouraging them. The plan gotta be postponed due to the sharp difference in the number.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1660":"[When you are racking your brain to figure out a plan, Shan Ji removes the broadsword around his waist and puts it on the table.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1661":"Worry not, my brother. The purge operation might be rushed. But look at the bright side, we can work it out differently.",
"challengeStoryDesc1662":"Brother, what do you got?",
"challengeStoryDesc1663":"[Shan Ji frowns his eyebrows. Reluctant as he is to miss the chance, he knows that the plan is only too risky.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1664":"Whether or not the bandit was bluffing, we have to stay prudent for our own good, or for the best outcome of the capture. We have to wait and see.",
"challengeStoryDesc1665":"Indeed. Despite the fact that the Yangzhou Garrison Troop is intrepid, we got a few hundreds only, far from enough against Lin Bao who got thousands.",
"challengeStoryDesc1666":"[Shan Ji releases a sigh, advocating for more prudence. He decides to dispatch more elite soldiers from the neighboring cities just in case.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1667":"Rest assured, brother. I'm gonna call for the backup force from the neighboring cities. To raise a new force of a few hundreds of men might take, let's say, five days. Then we might have a favorable odd against Lin Bao!",
"challengeStoryDesc1668":"Commander Shan, just lay low when you dispatch the soldiers. Make sure that Lin Bao won't notice it. Otherwise, the cunning guy may well be at large again.",
"challengeStoryDesc1669":"[You echo with the decision of Shan Ji but still think it necessary to collect more intelligence, with so many people concentrated in Hangzhou.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1670":"You will take care of the dispatch. And we just canceled the plan for the meeting three days later. Before you return, we will collect as much information as possible, in the preparation for the battle against Lin Bao.",
"challengeStoryDesc1671":"Commander Shan, do take good care of yourself, because you'll never know what's coming next.",
"challengeStoryDesc1672":"Don't worry. And you can't be more careful with your inquiry for intelligence. Lin Bao can literally see and hear anything in the city. A tiny mistake might turn you in to Lin Bao. But I will be back soon.",
"challengeStoryDesc1673":"[Then Shan Ji grabs the broadsword and walks out, only to hear an arrogant voice drifting from outside the Post.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1674":"Hey! I heard that your silk cousin is here from Yangzhou. So I guess you've prepared the tribute silk for Mr. Lin!",
"challengeStoryDesc1675":"[After giving the ruffians a beating, the guy restrains himself somewhat. Still, you can hear his belittling tone.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1676":"How dare you, a bunch of humble businessmen, show no respect for the subordinates of Mr. Lin? The lesson will be taught!",
"challengeStoryDesc1677":"Oh, the subordinates of Mr. Lin! I'm awfully sorry. I was speaking to my cousin who came all the way here. So I didn't hear you talking. I thought it was a small fry from nowhere. Please pardon me if I have offended you.",
"challengeStoryDesc1678":"[The rogue calms down with your proper apology.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1679":"Now that your silk-selling cousin is here, hand out the silk quickly. Hangzhou doesn't welcome a family of good-for-nothings!",
"challengeStoryDesc1680":"[Then speaks Prince Baylor who has been silent and lost in thoughts.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1681":"Your Highness, we're so sorry, but you know these days, Mr. Lin has imposed a measure for the personnel in and out.",
"challengeStoryDesc1682":"And my brother just came here to notify us the caravan got stopped by Mr. Lin's subordinates for rummage. It might be two or three days late, for which I beg your pardon!",
"challengeStoryDesc1683":"[The rogue nods as if convinced by Prince Baylor.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1684":"That can explain. Mr. Lin has sent quite a number of men to Yangzhou. It's not a surprise that one or two caravans got stopped.",
"challengeStoryDesc1685":"Alright, you can't be bold enough to fool Mr. Lin. Now that he happens to be in Yangzhou, I will give you a few more days. However, if there's no silk by the return of Mr. Lin, you will regret after all.",
"challengeStoryDesc1686":"[You are surprised to learn that Lin Bao left Hangzhou today for Yangzhou. You then hurries to raise a further question.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1687":"What takes Mr. Lin to Yangzhou at this point?",
"challengeStoryDesc1688":"The big name of Zhao Kang...Mr. Lin feels like making friends.",
"challengeStoryDesc1689":"Duanggggg~",
"challengeStoryDesc1690":"[Upon knowing Lin Bao has an axe to grind, Zhao An becomes so nervous that he tilts the tea cup over the table, only to smash the ceramic chips and splash water.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1691":"Hey, watch it. The lifeguard uniform is granted by Mr. Lin! Not something you can pay for.",
"challengeStoryDesc1692":"I feel so bad. But did you just mention Zhao Kang?",
"challengeStoryDesc1693":"Yep. The guy who would get a couple of dous of gold and gems for relocation. Oh, right. Is there any chance that one of you knows this guy?",
"challengeStoryDesc1694":"[Zhao An doesn't answer but shivers. It is Shan Ji who replies.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1695":"We all do. He is a big fish in Yangzhou! I happened to know him personally. And I can recommend Mr. Lin to him! May I know where Mr. Lin currently is.",
"challengeStoryDesc1696":"Oh, so you are the silk guy. And you know Zhao Kang? Do you know where his warehouse is?",
"challengeStoryDesc1697":"Yes. Zhao Kang likes my silk a lot. Warehouse? Hell yes. I deliver my goods to the their warehouse.",
"challengeStoryDesc1698":"[The ruffian can't help clapping hands with joy, as if he has done a great deed of merit for Lin Bao.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1699":"That couldn't be better! You will recommend Mr. Lin before Zhao Kang! Without exception, Mr. Lin will take a short break at the Huafu Inn, ten miles from the city. Remember that I am a part of merit, if any.",
"challengeStoryDesc1700":"[As the ruffian leaves, you shut the door and window, negotiating the plan against Lin Bao.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1701":"The plan's changed. But brother, you'd better hurry up and bring back more troops ASAP. And we'll take care of Lin Bao.",
"challengeStoryDesc1702":"Alright, I hope that won't give you and Prince Baylor too much trouble. Take care and I'll be back real soon.",
"challengeStoryDesc1703":"[After that, Shan Ji leaves the Post with his saber quickly, leaving you, Prince Baylor, Su Qi'er and anxious Zhao An in the hall.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1704":"[Immediately Shan Ji left, Zhao An kneels before you and Prince Baylor, wailing heavily.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1705":"Prince Baylor! Top Talent! I beseech you to save my son! He's everything our family has. Lin Bao surely has an obvious attempt, at our wealth. Your Highness, you can't just stand there and watch us burn!",
"challengeStoryDesc1706":"[Prince Baylor glances at Zhao An, putting on scorn.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1707":"Save it. Your son is no better than Lin Bao.",
"challengeStoryDesc1708":"That said, we won't have Lin Bao have his way in plaguing Yangzhou.",
"challengeStoryDesc1709":"Thank you so much, Prince Baylor and Top Talent!",
"challengeStoryDesc1710":"[Having relieved the worries of Zhao An, you start to deploy a new purge plan.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1711":"Prince Baylor, looks like we have to play to the score.",
"challengeStoryDesc1712":"Alright, we'll figure it out, one way or another. The top priority now is to disrupt Lin Bao's plan in Yangzhou.",
"challengeStoryDesc1713":"Mr. Su, the inn where Lin Bao stops, will you kindly please look into it? But remember not to beat the grass to frighten the snake. Collect the info and get back quick. We'll work out everything later.",
"challengeStoryDesc1714":"[Meanwhile, Lin Bao and his followers have arrived at Huafu Inn, ten miles from the city. It being late, Lin Bao decides to spend the night here.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1715":"Boss! Same old! Serve great wine and meat. Mr. Lin's here!",
"challengeStoryDesc1716":"Oh, my. Mr. Lin, what brings you here? Is there any chance...that the previous credit...",
"challengeStoryDesc1717":"Get lost. Just go prepare the dishes. We don't give a rat's ass about the bill.",
"challengeStoryDesc1718":"[At this point, Su Qi'er is bending over the inn's roof. He lifts the tiles and watches closely upon Lin Bao and others.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1719":"Lin Bao, you're not only a dick but also a miser. You don't even pay for a bill.",
"challengeStoryDesc1720":"[Then speaks Lin Bao.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1721":"You, and you, kick everyone out of the inn and deploy the guards around. I got a plan to make.",
"challengeStoryDesc1722":"[Having cleaned up the unnecessary personnel, Lin Bao and his subordinates begin to discuss the deployment in Yangzhou. Above, Su Qi'er is fully absorbed in the discussion.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1723":"How's the mobilization going back in Mount Zhongyi?",
"challengeStoryDesc1724":"You may rest assured, Your Highness. Our brothers have been moving towards Yangzhou, leaving behind a hundred for garrison. Given your unparalleled majesty, no one in Hangzhou will trespass into Mount Zhongyi.",
"challengeStoryDesc1725":"[Lin Bao nods as he listens, looking very satisfied.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1726":"[Great! You've earned yourselves a whole load of rewards! Oh, right. How's the deployment in Yangzhou?]",
"challengeStoryDesc1727":"Your Highness, large is too soft a word to describe the dispatch. It's about 1500 men. Each single inn, inside or outside Yangzhou, has been filled with our men. So the rest are arranged to station in the woods.",
"challengeStoryDesc1728":"[Lin Bao frowns upon hearing that. He raises his hand and slaps the guy in the face.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1729":"What an idiot! With so many people crowded in Yangzhou, you don't feel something's up? Pull them back!",
"challengeStoryDesc1730":"Your...Your Highness...I got it.",
"challengeStoryDesc1731":"Got it? Then move your ass! You're free to go. Or should I walk you out?",
"challengeStoryDesc1732":"[The berated bandit almost crawls out of the inn, untying a horse and heading towards Yangzhou.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1733":"[Inside, Lin Bao smashes the tea pot into the ground, only splashing the liquor all over. Those present look at each other, none bold enough to hold his anger.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1734":"Well...Your Highness, please calm down. It's been only one night. We can postpone and perfect the plan.",
"challengeStoryDesc1735":"My order is, three days later, we night-visit the Zhao's Mansion. I want nothing but success.",
"challengeStoryDesc1736":"Hope this wealthy Zhao Kang won't let me down.",
"challengeStoryDesc1737":"Please rest assured, Your Highness. If Zhao Kang won't cooperate, we will offer up the entire Yangzhou!",
"challengeStoryDesc1738":"[Lin Bao taps the table, sips the wine and hums the tune, fancy himself to be resting in piles of gold. He can't help laughing.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1739":"Well. Very well.",
"challengeStoryDesc1740":"[Meanwhile, Su Qi'er on the roof, covers the tile, and sets out for return.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1741":"Dog eat dog. But a thousand men for this? There will be a disaster in Yangzhou.",
"challengeStoryDesc1742":"No, I'd better hurry back to report this to Top Talent for a countermeasure.",
"challengeStoryDesc1743":"According to the subordinate of Lin Bao, the bandits from Mount Zhongyi are still on the way. Looks like I may well bump into them. Caution first.",
"challengeStoryDesc1744":"[It's been three hours since Su Qi'er went out. And it's now midnight. But everyone stays wide awake, waiting eagerly for the message of Su Qi'er.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1745":"[Finally, there comes a mild scratch of the tiles on the roof. Su Qi'er is back]",
"challengeStoryDesc1746":"Mr. Su, the outsiders are already in their sleep. You don't have to fly over the roof or window.",
"challengeStoryDesc1747":"Sir, I didn't fail the mission.",
"challengeStoryDesc1748":"Mr. Su, how was your trip? I saw some bandits in a hurry to someplace. You didn't bump into the bandits, did you?",
"challengeStoryDesc1749":"Rest assured, Top Talent. It's only that the bandits were heading towards Yangzhou.",
"challengeStoryDesc1750":"Did you get any information? We' can't wait. Let's figure it out while we are all here.",
"challengeStoryDesc1751":"For the purpose in Yangzhou, Lin Bao has literally mobilized all bandits in the Mount Zhongyi, numbered a thousand and five hundred or so, leaving a hundred at the post of garrison.",
"challengeStoryDesc1752":"What? Lin Bao surely is highly-motivated.",
"challengeStoryDesc1753":"That's right. Nevertheless, a thousand and five hundred men crowding into the inns overnight, it may well arouse vigilance in the city.",
"challengeStoryDesc1754":"[You can't help cracking a contemptuous smile upon hearing Lin Bao's mistake in the deployment.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1755":"Never expected Lin Bao to be that short-sighted. Still, that makes things a lot easier.",
"challengeStoryDesc1756":"I'll write a letter to Mr. Ji who's still in the Zhaos, soliciting his advice. And we will work together to trap the prey.",
"challengeStoryDesc1757":"Brilliant! As planned, Lin Bao's visit to the Zhaos will be three days later, which buys us enough time to arrange for the security of the Zhaos.",
"challengeStoryDesc1758":"[Upon your frequent reference to the Zhaos, Zhao An finally got himself together from the shock that his family has become a target of a thousand and five hundred men.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1759":"[Zhao An rises up trembling, takes your hand and beseeches you tearfully.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1760":"Top Talent, I am so indebted to you! You gotta save my son! He is the last one to get involved in this. What if these bandits, with their daggers and sabers, should do any harm to my son?",
"challengeStoryDesc1761":"[From the perspective of Zhao An, Zhao Kang is a decent officer who cares about the public and acts upon honesty and justice. But Su Qi'er gets amused by these words.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1762":"You are confusing right and wrong. And your son is anything but a good guy. After all this, Zhao Kang will have his punishment.",
"challengeStoryDesc1763":"[At this point, the door of the Post is knocked open by the bandits.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1764":"In the absence of Mr. Lin, you stay at the Post. We don't want to see you around. Otherwise you will be greeted with our weapons.",
"challengeStoryDesc1765":"[After giving a beating to the flagrant bandits, the crowd returns to the hall for countermeasures.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1766":"Unbridled are these minions of Lin Bao. No one's in their charge now. And those patrolling officers are like totally blind to them.",
"challengeStoryDesc1767":"Tell me about it. The bandits are bold enough to trespass into the Zhaos, ignoring the authority of the court!",
"challengeStoryDesc1768":"[Zhao An echoes with the voice, trying to picture Lin Bao as the most cursed man in the world.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1769":"Bash!",
"challengeStoryDesc1770":"[Prince Baylor, with a grave look, bashes the table to drown the nags of Zhao An. He dares not make any more sound and crouches his body to a corner, minimizing the perception of his existence.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1771":"[For a moment, no one dares to speak in the hall. It becomes so quiet that even the a needle hitting the ground can be heard.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1772":"Lin Bao and his minions have been flying brazenly in defiance of the laws. The crimes they've committed to the public deserve a proper sentence!",
"challengeStoryDesc1773":"[After a long pause, Prince Baylor stands up banging the table and moves towards the door.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1774":"Fancy that the sinner should be esteemed as the pillar of the nation. What a joke! I swear to the nation that I will eliminate the menace and put Lin down to ground!",
"challengeStoryDesc1775":"[From the Post, you can still see the flickering torches on the street. It looks like quite a lot of bandits are now cruising on guard.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1776":"[You comes up to Prince Baylor.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1777":"Prince Baylor, hold on please. I got something to say!",
"challengeStoryDesc1778":"[Prince Baylor looks back at you and stops. He nods his head, signaling you to continue.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1779":"[You know very clearly that it's your only shot to instill sobriety in Prince Baylor. You take a deep breath and then present your analysis.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1780":"The way I see it, those bandits in Hangzhou are doing evil with the borrowed power. According to Mr. Su, the bandits left on the Mount Zhongyi are numbered a few hundreds. And there are as few as a hundred placed inside Hangzhou.",
"challengeStoryDesc1781":"Therefore, the vastly outnumbering citizens are the biggest problem to these bandits, as evidenced by their sensational patrol.",
"challengeStoryDesc1782":"[Prince Baylor strokes his beard, reflects and is convinced by your words.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1783":"So you mean, our top priority is to look beyond these bandits?",
"challengeStoryDesc1784":"Impressive wisdom! Now that the bandits are placed in the city, Mount Zhongyi must find itself short-handed, which offers an excellent change to siege and purge. Meanwhile, the pressing situation in Yangzhou needs our attention.",
"challengeStoryDesc1785":"I gotta deliver the letter to Mr. Ji with the pigeons and see what he replies.",
"challengeStoryDesc1786":"Your Highness, when I returned, I saw bandits shooting the pigeons in the vicinity, as if for fear that someone in Hangzhou should lead information out. You may wait till I finish those bandits.",
"challengeStoryDesc1787":"[Su Qi'er leaves the Post with your letter and soon, Su Qi'er returns when the lights on the street are put out.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1788":"Your Highness, I flied a pigeon and I saw it flying across the city with my eyes. The letter is estimated to arrive at Mr. Ji by tomorrow morning.",
"challengeStoryDesc1789":"Sorry to have troubled you. I guess we'll just wait for the reply from Mr. Ji.",
"challengeStoryDesc1790":"Prince Baylor, there is one more thing that I gotta say.",
"challengeStoryDesc1791":"[You're fully aware that your reference to the thing may well get under the skin of Prince Baylor. But you have to take into account the worst result.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1792":"Whatever the reply of Mr.Ji, I'd recommend Prince Baylor to stay at the Post and grant the leadership to me. I shall never fail you.",
"challengeStoryDesc1793":"[Prince Baylor reveals the sharpness in the eyes and measures you back and forth.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1794":"What do you mean, Top Talent?",
"challengeStoryDesc1795":"[You knew it early that the recommendation will arouse the suspicion of Prince Baylor. So you take a step forward, prepared for a thorough explanation.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1796":"[But before you do so, Zhao An, who has been crouching in the corner, picks up the topic.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1797":"Good point there! Prince Baylor is the royal member. Swords never recognize your nobility, for which we'll be held accountable. Bringing Lin Bao to justice, it's something Commander Shan and Top Talent may act on behalf!",
"challengeStoryDesc1798":"Top Talent, are you with Zhao An? You thinking I'm a fragile vase that needs nursing?",
"challengeStoryDesc1799":"[Prince Baylor seems irritated by your underestimation of his ability.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1800":"Top Talent, I've always held you in high esteems. But you take me as those who fear of death?",
"challengeStoryDesc1801":"[While pointing at the flattering Zhao An, Prince Baylor rests his eyes on you, as if trying to looking you through.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1802":"[You open your mouth, with thousand of plausible explanations flashing by. But when you look at the questioning eyes of Prince Baylor, you find words stuck in your throat.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1803":"[You feel like saying something, only to be raced by Zhao An.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1804":"Impossible! Given the ferocious troops of Lin Bao, the Post can't be a solid fortress. I volunteer to stay here in your service and to address the concerns of Commander Shan and Top Talent.",
"challengeStoryDesc1805":"[Zhao An keeps nagging, with a sole purpose to stay in the Post.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1806":"Shut up! I was asking Top Talent! Did I grant you permission to talk?",
"challengeStoryDesc1807":"[The berated Zhao An crouches back to the corner and remains silent. Prince Baylor pays no attention to him but takes up a cup of cold tea, waiting for you reply.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1808":"[You think it over and utters.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1809":"It's not true. I know very well that Prince Baylor has the intention to root out the menaces in the court and the aspiration to display exceptional heroism. But the purge is so unpredictable. We have to ensure nothing goes wrong.",
"challengeStoryDesc1810":"[Your explanation does quench the rage of Prince Baylor.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1811":"Nothing goes wrong? But how?",
"challengeStoryDesc1812":"We have two viable options. First, we siege Mount Zhaoyi with the Yangzhou Garrison Troop in the absence of Lin Bao.",
"challengeStoryDesc1813":"And second, we can work with Mr. Ji to arrange ambushes in Yangzhou and drag Lin Bao into the battle against the troops brought by Commander Shan.",
"challengeStoryDesc1814":"Okay. But I don't see why I should stay at the Post in Hangzhou.",
"challengeStoryDesc1815":"We will definitely go to Yangzhou. Should the bandits on the Mount Zhongyi have no counter force, they may well get us sandwiched, which will be the last thing we wanna see.",
"challengeStoryDesc1816":"[Prince Baylor nods in agreement.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1817":"Indeed. I was being short-sighted. Please go on.",
"challengeStoryDesc1818":"Aye. The Yangzhou Garrison Troop in the North Yard of the northern city is affiliated with the court, hence only the order of His Majesty or the immediate superiors may mobilize it.",
"challengeStoryDesc1819":"[Now that Brother has gone somewhere else to send for troops. Your Imperial Edict and your identity as a royal member are key to granting control of the Yangzhou Garrison Troop and counterchecking the bandits of Mount Zhongyi.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1820":"[Prince Baylor looks pleased as he nods his head and strokes his beard. Now you know that Prince Baylor has agreed to stay at the Post.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1821":"Great! You are indeed an asset, Top Talent. You outwitted me.",
"challengeStoryDesc1822":"[You look humble in front of the compliments of Prince Baylor.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1823":"I'm flattered. But thank you.",
"challengeStoryDesc1824":"Besides, we'll never know until the danger occurs. If that should be the case, you can return to the capital for reinforcement and another purge action!",
"challengeStoryDesc1825":"Top Talent, don't jinx it!",
"challengeStoryDesc1826":"[You nod your head. Tough as the journey might be, you know the journey must be a successful one.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1827":"Rest assured, Prince Baylor. Me and Brother won't let you down.",
"challengeStoryDesc1828":"Whatever the plan of Mr. Ji, you do take good care of yourself and act with utmost discreetness.",
"challengeStoryDesc1829":"Roger that. It's late at night. Let's just call it a day and wait for the reply of Mr. Ji.",
"challengeStoryDesc1830":"Top Talent, Prince Baylor, I volunteer to stay up. Given the patrolling bandits, I fear that contingencies should occur.",
"challengeStoryDesc1831":"[The following day before the dawn breaks, you receive the pigeon-carried letter from Mr. Ji.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1832":"This early morning, I received a letter from Mr. Ji. He must have sent the letter last night.",
"challengeStoryDesc1833":"[As you say so, you open the letter from Ji Xiaolan in front of everyone.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1834":"[You skim the lines on the letter, feeling somewhat assured.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1835":"As I expected…",
"challengeStoryDesc1836":"[Su Qi'er seems to be out of patience. He hurries to ask what's in the letter.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1837":"Your Highness, what is the plan of Mr. Ji?",
"challengeStoryDesc1838":"[You shake your head as you hand the letter to Prince Baylor.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1839":"Mr. Ji didn't mention much in the letter. But he implies the confusion of the citizens in Yangzhou about the fully taken inns.",
"challengeStoryDesc1840":"[Prince Baylor reads the letter over and over again and checks for an interlayer before he utters. ]",
"challengeStoryDesc1841":"Mr. Ji might be saying that the Yangzhou citizens have been somewhat informed and wary of the bandits.",
"challengeStoryDesc1842":"Mr. Ji should have been worried that the flying pigeon had been shot in the middle of the flight, so he didn't dare to say what he thought in the letter. But he invited us to get together in Zhao Fu, Yangzhou.",
"challengeStoryDesc1843":"The way I see it, Mr. Ji might have given us his recommendation.",
"challengeStoryDesc1844":"Oh? Really?",
"challengeStoryDesc1845":"Mr. Ji was asking me and Brother for a reunion in Yangzhou. Now that Mr. Ji goes on with the invitation, he might be suggesting that Brother led the troops to Yangzhou.",
"challengeStoryDesc1846":"[Prince Baylor nods repeatedly with relief, upon hearing your explanation.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1847":"You are as talented as Mr. Ji. And it's always been a pleasure talking to the talented. I wonder if Mr. Ji has the intention to serve the country in the court, 'cause I can recommend him to His Majesty.",
"challengeStoryDesc1848":"I make no match for Mr. Ji. He is a remarkable talent like no one else, who had a hard time in pursuing his official career. I really want to say thank-you on behalf of Mr. Ji for your acting as a scout.",
"challengeStoryDesc1849":"I gotta write a letter to Brother, asking him to lead the troops to Yangzhou. And we'll be seeing him there.",
"challengeStoryDesc1850":"Then everything will count on Top Talent and Commander Shan. Please take good care.",
"challengeStoryDesc1851":"Please rest assured, Prince Baylor. I won't fail you.",
"challengeStoryDesc1852":"Mr. Su, sorry if it troubles you that you go to check whether there are lingering bandits around the Post. That they shoot down the pigeons will only make things worse.",
"challengeStoryDesc1853":"[It doesn't take long before Su Qi'er returns.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1854":"Don't worry, Your Highness, those lingering bandits are no more a problem. Your letter will go to Commander Shan, safe and sound.",
"challengeStoryDesc1855":"Sorry to have troubled you. It's only that...I feel dwarfed by the wariness and discreetness of Mr. Ji. And I couldn't tell for sure the best way to deliver the letter to Brother.",
"challengeStoryDesc1856":"Given the complicated situation, the conspicuous men of Lin Bao and the unpredictable lurking risks of the pigeon's delivery, I really fear that I might frighten the snakes and cause unintended consequences.",
"challengeStoryDesc1857":"If you trust me, I will hand the letter to Commander Shan personally and hurry back to Yangzhou to meet you there.",
"challengeStoryDesc1858":"The secret dispatch of Brother concerns many fronts. We gotta keep a low profile. And you are indeed the best option to deliver the letter.",
"challengeStoryDesc1859":"Thank you for your trust. I won't fall short of your expectation!",
"challengeStoryDesc1860":"Thank you, too. So let's take separate actions. And I will go to Yangzhou first. Tomorrow noon, me and Mr. Ji will be waiting for you at the Zhaos.",
"challengeStoryDesc1861":"Rest assured, Your Highness. Time's too pressing for a farewell. On your way to Yangzhou, there are a lot of bandits. Do take care. I'm leaving now. See you tomorrow in Yangzhou.",
"challengeStoryDesc1862":"You take care, too, Mr. Su.",
"challengeStoryDesc1863":"[Su Qi'er jumps across the window without making a noise. You are going to pack up things for Yangzhou when Prince Baylor pushes open the door.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1864":"Top Talent, have you packed up things yet? When are you leaving?",
"challengeStoryDesc1865":"[You think it over and go fetch a dagger behind the pillow. With all those unpredictable factors, you decided to travel light.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1866":"For this trip, I'll disguise myself as a businessman who returns to Yangzhou for his merchandise. I have to travel light, so the dagger will be my only belonging for my protection.",
"challengeStoryDesc1867":"[Upon hearing [protection], Prince Baylor thinks of Su Qi'er, the Retainer. He looks around, not seeing Su Qi'er but a wide open window. So he jokes.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1868":"Mr. Su is quite a man of mystery who jumps and flies around, but never walks.",
"challengeStoryDesc1869":"[You laugh about it and reserve your judgment for Mr. Su unrestrained nature.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1870":"Never ever has been Mr. Su restrained by rites. Please forgive him for that.",
"challengeStoryDesc1871":"I didn't see a pigeon fly. Did you ask Mr. Su to send the letter?",
"challengeStoryDesc1872":"Yeah. I thought about it. Pigeon-delivery is too risky. So I had to bother Mr. Su.",
"challengeStoryDesc1873":"Do take best care of yourself when you are all alone out there. I'm giving you this Dragon-Grained Dagger. Try it if you please. Watch out! Your side! Assassin!",
"challengeStoryDesc1874":"[The assassin gets away with the wounds you've given. Prince Baylor pulls out the blood-stained Dragon-Grained Dagger from on the wall, wipes it carefully with the silk handkerchief and passes it to you.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1875":"Take it. The Dragon-Grained Dagger gets sharper with blood, an ideal choice for protection.",
"challengeStoryDesc1876":"[The moment you see the dragon grain on the dagger, you know that it is a largess from His Majesty. You are hesitant whether to accept it. ]",
"challengeStoryDesc1877":"Prince Baylor, the dagger...it's so precious. I'm only too... humble.",
"challengeStoryDesc1878":"[Quite the opposite, Prince Baylor seems to be taking nothing to mind.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1879":"[Just take it. That's why I'm here. I wanna give the dagger to you before you leave.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1880":"I am really flattered. But the dagger was bestowed by His Majesty. I'm not bold enough to put it in my use.",
"challengeStoryDesc1881":"[Prince Baylor reads you worry. He shakes hands as he explains.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1882":"[His Majesty bestowed this to me for my protection before I left the capital. It represents the imperial authority. In case that the Yangzhou government should disobey your order, show them the Dragon-Grained Dagger. ]",
"challengeStoryDesc1883":"Aristocrat? You mean the assassin?",
"challengeStoryDesc1884":"[Prince Baylor nods his head, wearing an anxious look.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1885":"Just now, a report from court agents that the Yangzhou Aristocrat was about to make waves, fearing that the invading thousand-men troop is led by you and Commander Shan. And the Yangzhou Aristocrat would like to attack beforehand.",
"challengeStoryDesc1886":"I was asking you to take care, only to see the assassin coming for you.",
"challengeStoryDesc1887":"How audacious is the Yangzhou Aristocrat. My life isn't worth a dime but I am acting as an Imperial Commissioner. And that flagrant assassination is literally an ignorance of laws and authority!",
"challengeStoryDesc1888":"Which entails the Dragon-Grained Dagger. You may need it when you deal with the Yangzhou Aristocrat.",
"challengeStoryDesc1889":"If you insist, Prince Baylor. Thank you for your grace and care.",
"challengeStoryDesc1890":"[You put away the dagger, walk towards the yard of the Post, and bid a farewell to Prince Baylor.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1891":"Prince Baylor, that's it. You do take care. In case of any contingency, ask someone from the North Yard to deliver the letter. My Brother and I will do our utmost to keep you safe.",
"challengeStoryDesc1892":"Great. I'm glad to be a friend of you and Commander Shan! You be careful, too. There are quite a lot of bandits patrolling outside. Make sure that you don't get busted.",
"challengeStoryDesc1893":"[You avoid the patrolling bandits and take the secret tunnel under the North Yard.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1894":"[You look back before you leave. Hangzhou seems to be sparkling with Beauty as before. No one has ever pictured its people suffering from Lin Bao's oppression. ]",
"challengeStoryDesc1895":"[You clench your fists and swear to yourself that you will restore the bright yesterday for the Hangzhou people. ]",
"challengeStoryDesc1896":"[You whip the horse even more and soon you arrive at the Huafu Inn where Lin Bao is said to be taking a break here.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1897":"[It's the only way from Hangzhou to Yangzhou. In order to avoid Lin Bao, you try to walk past from behind it and then leave.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1898":"[On the other side, the bandits are calling out to their companions, in an attempt to bully the passing travelers.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1899":"Everyone, get your weapon, blockade the road and fence off the loaded pigs.",
"challengeStoryDesc1900":"Mr. Lin promised to entertain us to a grand feast if you finish the job nicely. For the wines and meat!",
"challengeStoryDesc1901":"All hail to Mr. Lin. For the wines and meat!",
"challengeStoryDesc1902":"[The reward has got the bandits into raptures. They take the swords and axes with them, heading outward.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1903":"[You are hiding in a corner next to the stable, pondering at breaking the encirclement without Lin Bao noticing it.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1904":"Lin Bao is getting far above himself. Naturally, it can't be the first time.",
"challengeStoryDesc1905":"[You clench your fist tightly, not resigning yourself to the fact that you will just leave like this and let Lin Bao bully those travelers.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1906":"[The roof of the stable gives a slight knock when you are in the dilemma.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1907":"[You look up and recognize Su Qi'er popping out his head. You are thrilled to see him, for you're assured of the safe transfer of the letter to Shan ji.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1908":"Mr. Su! Was the letter received?",
"challengeStoryDesc1909":"[Su Qi'er jumps down from the roof and stands up next to you, nodding in an answer.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1910":"Your Highness, you may rest assured. The letter was received. I'm sorry if I get you frightened.",
"challengeStoryDesc1911":"It's okay. Any word from Brother?",
"challengeStoryDesc1912":"I did bring a message from Commander Shan. I'll tell you later after we get out of here.",
"challengeStoryDesc1913":"[Having left the Huafu Inn with Su Qi'er and entered the official road, you finally give a sigh of relief.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1914":"Thank you for your timely help; otherwise I could have been trapped there.",
"challengeStoryDesc1915":"Don't be like that. It is the duty of a Retainer to protect the host. Now that we hit the official road, Lin Bao can't be bold enough to make trouble here.",
"challengeStoryDesc1916":"[Su Qi'er walks on whereas you look back, with hesitation. Su Qi'er notices that you are not with him and feels somewhat puzzled.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1917":"What's up, Your Highness. Anything wrong?",
"challengeStoryDesc1918":"Nothing. It's only that if we leave like this, those travelers will get plagued by Lin Bao. Isn't that bad?",
"challengeStoryDesc1919":"[Su Qi'er waves his hand, looking confident.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1920":"Rest assured, Your Highness. Before I came here, I put up one signboard on the crossroad, saying [Caution! Hounds]. No one will take that way. Those bandits will end up nothing.",
"challengeStoryDesc1921":"Marvelous! I wanna thank you on behalf of those travelers.",
"challengeStoryDesc1922":"[Su Qi'er seems to be not comfortable with your serious compliments. He scratches head and understates it.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1923":"[Well, I have good teachers, you and Mr. Ji.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1924":"Now that we have lost Lin Bao and entered the official road, our safety is guaranteed. So now, Mr. Su, would you like to give me the message from Brother?",
"challengeStoryDesc1925":"Right. Commander Shan is now in Songjiang Town where he has raised an army of over six hundred men, excellent and valiant. According to Commander Shan, the mob of Lin Bao won't be a problem at all.",
"challengeStoryDesc1926":"Wonderful! But Songjiang Town is a little far away from Yangzhou. And Brother has to lead this whole army...",
"challengeStoryDesc1927":"Correct. That's what Commander Shan is worry about. He said that he would send troops in batches lest the devil should get awakened.",
"challengeStoryDesc1928":"[The large scale and the long distance may well cost some time, which adds to your anxiety. You hurries to ask.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1929":"Mr. Su, when will be the earliest arrival of Brother at Yangzhou?",
"challengeStoryDesc1930":"The evening three days after. So thought Commander Shan.",
"challengeStoryDesc1931":"Hush! Someone coming this way!",
"challengeStoryDesc1932":"[You and Su Qi'er knock him out and put him under a tree.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1933":"He didn't see us. And the coma might last three or four hours, by when we'll have been almost in Yangzhou.",
"challengeStoryDesc1934":"Thank you, Mr. Su. It's good to know that he won't disrupt our plan.",
"challengeStoryDesc1935":"Your Highness, let's roll. We gotta leave before Lin Bao smells anything fishy.",
"challengeStoryDesc1936":"[You look up at the stretching official road, knowing clearly that the unpredictable is lying ahead. And one cannot be too optimistic about the situation in Yangzhou.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1937":"Okay. I wonder whether the bandits have trampled upon the people in Yangzhou. Every minute counts. Let's go!",
"challengeStoryDesc1938":"[You and Su Qi'er pick up your pace to Yangzhou.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1939":"[On the way, you analyze the status quo of the bandits sieging Yangzhou and recall the deployment of Shan Ji, feeling somewhat worried.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1940":"Mr. Su, you were saying that Brother could get troops deployed in Yangzhou in three days at earliest, weren't you?",
"challengeStoryDesc1941":"Yes, Your Highness. Anything wrong?",
"challengeStoryDesc1942":"[You eyebrows twitch upon hearing the reply. You begin to think about how to delay the operation of the bandits in Yangzhou.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1943":"I can recall that Lin Bao would night-visit the Zhaos tomorrow. We gotta come up with a plan to stall Lin Bao.",
"challengeStoryDesc1944":"Oh, Commander Shan referred to the household guards affiliated to the Yangzhou Aristocrat. We may as well borrow the force when we confront Lin Bao.",
"challengeStoryDesc1945":"[An idea occurs to you upon the reference to the Yangzhou Aristocrat.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1946":"[Su Qi'er finds your confident smile to be confusing.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1947":"Your Highness, what's with that look? You got an idea to install Lin Bao?",
"challengeStoryDesc1948":"[You shake your head, for you know the move is too dangerous. Further perfection and consideration are necessary. So you don't reveal the plan to Su Qi'er.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1949":"It's risky. I need to consult Mr. Ji when we arrive at Yangzhou before we finally work out the plan.",
"challengeStoryDesc1950":"If so, I will stand ready to your assignment. Behold, Your Highness! Isn't that the Yangzhou City Gate?",
"challengeStoryDesc1951":"It didn't take long! But...there seems to be a lot of bandits patrolling around the gate. How are we supposed to get in there?",
"challengeStoryDesc1952":"Let me take care of it.",
"challengeStoryDesc1953":"[After Su Qi'er knocks out the bandits patrolling around, you manage to arrive at the gate unimpededly.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1954":"Finally we are here. The few days in Hangzhou is like months.",
"challengeStoryDesc1955":"Tell me about it. But Yangzhou seems different from what we knew when we left. The closed gate, and the deadly dullness. We gotta be careful, because it can be a trap of Lin Bao in there.",
"challengeStoryDesc1956":"[An arrogant yell comes from behind when you are reaching for identity documents and the access to Yangzhou.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1957":"Hey, who the hell are you? Don't you know Yangzhou has been under curfew? Now walk, while you can. Out of my way.",
"challengeStoryDesc1958":"[You make an eye contact with Su Qi'er, knowing that a prudent reply is a must. Otherwise, it might have dampened all efforts made.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1959":"[You force a smile as you turn around.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1960":"Sir, you must be the general under Mr. Lin Bao from Hangzhou, aren't you?",
"challengeStoryDesc1961":"[The bandit is somewhat surprised at first but doesn't really take it to his mind that you recognize him.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1962":"Yes and what? Mr. Lin has been a household name. Don't you fool me around with his name. Tell me, what you doing up here?",
"challengeStoryDesc1963":"[Knowing it doesn't work, you play by the simulated situation.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1964":"Look, me and brother are natives here. Days ago, we went to Hangzhou for the silk tribute to Mr. Lin.",
"challengeStoryDesc1965":"Right. And Mr. Lin happens to know we are old acquaintances of Zhao Kang. So he sends us to the Zhaos for internal coordination. And tomorrow, we take the Zhaos.",
"challengeStoryDesc1966":"[Your explanation seems plausible, as you even know the exact operation date. Convinced by what you said, his attitude softens.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1967":"Brothers. No offense. I was acting upon Mr. Lin. You know, well served; long lived.",
"challengeStoryDesc1968":"Since you are brothers for the same cause. Come on inside. Don't ruin Mr. Lin's plan.",
"challengeStoryDesc1969":"[As the bandit waves his hand, the city gate opens in front of you. You and Su Qi'er then give a sigh of relief.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1970":"[The voice catches you up before you are leaving.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1971":"Hey, aren't you businessmen? Mr. Lin sent you here and you don't know the proper code of Mr. Lin?",
"challengeStoryDesc1972":"Yes! Yes! I understand.",
"challengeStoryDesc1973":"[Su Qi'er wears an ingratiating smile as he reaches the pocket for purse. ]",
"challengeStoryDesc1974":"[After Su Qi'er brings down the bandit, he dangles the purse before him complacently.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1975":"[There's no such code of Mr. Lin to rip off brothers. You don't want Mr. Lin to know that, do you? Mind your business!]",
"challengeStoryDesc1976":"Alright, Brother Su, don't waste your time. We got a mission for Mr. Lin.",
"challengeStoryDesc1977":"[You and Su Qi'er are much relieved to hear the city gate closing behind you.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1978":"[You walk along the familiar streets and head towards the Zhaos on the east. It's morning already, yet no one's on the street. The stores and houses have been shut, silent as hell]",
"challengeStoryDesc1979":"Your Highness, do you feel something wrong with Yangzhou?",
"challengeStoryDesc1980":"[You look around and have the feeling that the formerly hustling and bustling Yangzhou has been reduced into deadly depression within a few days.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1981":"Hush. We are only two businessmen. No another word. Let's just go to the Zhaos!",
"challengeStoryDesc1982":"[That said, you add in lip-language.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1983":"Yangzhou might have been controlled by Lin Bao. His spies could be anywhere. We must lay low and reserve judgments.",
"challengeStoryDesc1984":"[Su Qi'er nods as he understands you. He turns up the volume in a reply.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1985":"I get it. We can't ruin the plan of Mr. Lin. Let's roll!",
"challengeStoryDesc1986":"[With that, Su Qi'er walks on in front of you, guarding against any lurking danger.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1987":"[Soon, you arrive at the Zhaos, formerly thronged with people but now visited by none.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1988":"[Su Qi'er walks up to knock at the door. It takes a while before someone comes to answer the door, trembling.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1989":"Who...who is it? The one you are looking for is not around, our Master or Young Master. Just leave.",
"challengeStoryDesc1990":"[You look closely, only to recognize him to be the unbridled butler. He seems to have aged during the past few days.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1991":"Butler, do you still remember us?",
"challengeStoryDesc1992":"[The butler approaches for a closer look. He almost kneels down the moment he feels that savior has come. Su Qi'er hurries to get him up and explains in whispers.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1993":"Hush! Spies are everywhere. We'll talk after I take them down.",
"challengeStoryDesc1994":"[After Su Qi'er finishes the spies, the butler invites you in carefully and close up the gate tightly.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1995":"[As soon as the door is closed, the butler kneels down before you, begging in tears.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1996":"Honorable Imperial Commissioner! Please save our Young Master and the entire mansion!",
"challengeStoryDesc1997":"[To avoid the attention of the spies in Yangzhou, you get the butler up quickly and comfort him with a lowered voice.]",
"challengeStoryDesc1998":"Calm down. Tell us, what happened to Yangzhou when we were not around? How are the Zhaos doing?",
"challengeStoryDesc1999":"[Your question moves the butler into tears even more. He takes your sleeve as he cries.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2000":"Your Highness, do save us! A few days ago, our Master went to Yangzhou to deliver the message. And no one's in charge here. It happens that we get preyed upon by a bunch of bandits. As servants, we really don't know what to do.",
"challengeStoryDesc2001":"Where's your Young Master?",
"challengeStoryDesc2002":"Oh, it's a long story. Ever since Master left, the Young Master has been a bundle of nerves for his property. He confines himself to the warehouse all day long, and even sleeps with the gold bullion. No one can persuade him.",
"challengeStoryDesc2003":"[You cast eyes to Su Qi'er, knowing the Zhaos are beset with troubles.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2004":"Butler, the Zhaos will be under our watch. Those bandits won't have their way.",
"challengeStoryDesc2005":"But now, the top priority is to find Mr. Ji. The bandits come in full swing, so we have to figure out a proper countermeasure.",
"challengeStoryDesc2006":"Alright. Mr. Ji is in there. I'll show you the way.",
"challengeStoryDesc2007":"[The butler takes you and Su Qi'er to the front hall. Before you put a step in, you can hear the discussion inside the hall.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2008":"[The butler pushes open the door. Quickly you go inside as you offer greetings.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2009":"Mr. Ji, me and Mr. Su are here. What has happened to Yangzhou these days?",
"challengeStoryDesc2010":"My lord, welcome back.",
"challengeStoryDesc2011":"Your Highness, it's been a while. How are you doing?",
"challengeStoryDesc2012":"[The two men in the hall stand up to greet you. Upon a close look, you find Liu Yong right next to Mr. Ji.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2013":"Mr. Liu! What brings you here? How is Sha County?",
"challengeStoryDesc2014":"Don't worry, Your Highness. Everything's fine in Sha County. A few days ago, Mr. Ji wrote me a letter, inviting me to Yangzhou. So here I am.",
"challengeStoryDesc2015":"That's great. Mr. Liu must have known the gravity of situation in Yangzhou. Now that every second counts, I'd love to know what you will propose.",
"challengeStoryDesc2016":"Your Highness! Hang on. I'll keep guard for you. The Zhaos must have become the target of the bandits. We can never be too careful.",
"challengeStoryDesc2017":"[After Su Qi'er leaves the room, you take the distinguished seat. The butler serves the tea and leaves for your convenience.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2018":"Although I've been put in such a dangerous situation, Mr. Ji and Mr. Liu feel like offering your insightful advice, which relieves me quite a lot.",
"challengeStoryDesc2019":"We are flattered. It's a Retainer's duty to ensure your safety.",
"challengeStoryDesc2020":"I admire your talent and I owe you much. So I'm more than willing to address your concerns.",
"challengeStoryDesc2021":"[After you give ritual greetings, you go on with the discussion on the purge of Hangzhou and the siege of Lin Bao.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2022":"Here's the thing. It's in the evening three days from now that Brother will arrive at Yangzhou. However, Lin Bao is gonna night-visit the Zhaos tomorrow.",
"challengeStoryDesc2023":"So, Lin Bao will siege the Zhaos the day after tomorrow at latest?",
"challengeStoryDesc2024":"That's true, and it's a little bit tricky.",
"challengeStoryDesc2025":"[Ji Xiaolan waves his hand, signaling you to put aside your anxiety.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2026":"The matter, I've covered it in the discussion with Brother Liu. You don't have to worry about that. We will explain everything to you.",
"challengeStoryDesc2027":"Misters, your wits do warrant a victory a thousand miles away. I'm all ears.",
"challengeStoryDesc2028":"Yesterday, all inns of Yangzhou were taken by the bandits overnight, which is one major flaw of Lin Bao's plan.",
"challengeStoryDesc2029":"Right. Everyone in Yangzhou has felt the threat. The aristocrats all fear that the bandits are coming for them. From what I know, they were even training their household guards today.",
"challengeStoryDesc2030":"So, we may as well pool the power of the aristocrats in Yangzhou. We set up the bandits, buy some time and wait till Commander Shan returns with the army.",
"challengeStoryDesc2031":"[Your worries seem to be cast away by the confident look in Mr. Ji and Mr. Liu.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2032":"Misters, have you any brilliant plan?",
"challengeStoryDesc2033":"We may complement each other with the aristocrats in Yangzhou. We all know that the bandits are on the attack. Then why not put everything on the table. We pretend to welcome these bandits and stage the Empty Fort strategy.",
"challengeStoryDesc2034":"[When you are gonna ask for more details, there come the clanks of swords. Mr. Ji smiles as he hears the noise.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2035":"Look, we don't even have to visit our allies. They are here for us.",
"challengeStoryDesc2036":"Mr. Ji, do you mean...those are from the aristocrats in Yangzhou?",
"challengeStoryDesc2037":"We'll have the answer by just walking out.",
"challengeStoryDesc2038":"[You follow Mr. Ji and walk out. Outside, Su Qi'er has tied up the killers and brought them before you.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2039":"Your Highness, the killer's arrogant enough to bend over the roof to spy. Fancy myself to get ignored.",
"challengeStoryDesc2040":"Thank you, Mr. Su. The guest should have been greeted with proper manners.",
"challengeStoryDesc2041":"[With that, you request Su Qi'er to bring the killer inside and get him a seat. The killer looks somewhat confounded.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2042":"Gentleman in the air. No offense.",
"challengeStoryDesc2043":"What...what do ya want? I was hired to collect intelligence. And I know nothing else. There's no point interrogating me.",
"challengeStoryDesc2044":"[Ji Xiaolan couldn't help wearing a faint smile at the sight of the frightened killer.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2045":"Don't be afraid. Interrogation won't be necessary. We've known you were sent by the Yangzhou Aristocrats",
"challengeStoryDesc2046":"How do you know that? No—",
"challengeStoryDesc2047":"[Knowing he has been tricked by words, the killer shuts his mouth, giving no more an answer. So Ji Xiaolan decides to cut it straight to what he truly wants.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2048":"Since you were sent by the Yangzhou Aristocrats, you must have known the identity of our lord.",
"challengeStoryDesc2049":"[The killer doesn't answer. But Ji Xiaolan isn't much bothered and he continues.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2050":"You see, the bandits are gonna siege Yangzhou, with an eye to the wealth of the whole city. With the enemies ahead, it's not the your wealth but our lord's whereabouts that you care about. What a weird thing.",
"challengeStoryDesc2051":"Save your crocodile's tears!",
"challengeStoryDesc2052":"We are all in Yangzhou, faced with the incoming bandits. Aren't we supposed to watch each other's back?",
"challengeStoryDesc2053":"[The killer looks hesitant, as if convinced by Ji Xiaolan's words.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2054":"Well...do you have a way out?",
"challengeStoryDesc2055":"Of course we do. We'll let you go and you'll convey our intention of cooperation to your employer. Just let him judge what's in the best interest.",
"challengeStoryDesc2056":"[Having said so, Ji Xiaolan loosens the rope and sets him free. Then flashes a dagger—]",
"challengeStoryDesc2057":"Mr. Ji! Look out!",
"challengeStoryDesc2058":"[The killer jumps across the window and escapes. Mr. Ji looks down, as if wondering. You come up to him, and check whether he's wounded.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2059":"Mr. Ji, you alright?",
"challengeStoryDesc2060":"[Ji Xiaolan, half-kneeling, feels his waist-side where there is an obvious rip.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2061":"[The rip isn't deep. It even doesn't reach the underclothes, which indicates that the killer wasn't gonna claim a life.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2062":"[Ji Xiaolan waves his hand, signals he's fine and stands up.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2063":"I'm fine. The killer just took my token, to report himself on the mission perhaps.",
"challengeStoryDesc2064":"It's good to know that. But...Mr. Ji, do you believe the Yangzhou Aristocrats will shake hands with us that easily?",
"challengeStoryDesc2065":"The enemy gives them no choice buy compromise. Still, the Yangzhou Aristocrats can't be fully trusted.",
"challengeStoryDesc2066":"Alright, while we are waiting for their reply, we'd better sit down and work on the plan to install Lin Bao.",
"challengeStoryDesc2067":"Looks like Mr. Liu has something on the mind.",
"challengeStoryDesc2068":"Even if the Yangzhou Aristocrats promise to lend their force, we are vastly outnumbered by Lin Bao. If we wanna install him, we have to let down his guard.",
"challengeStoryDesc2069":"We can invite the Yangzhou Aristocrats and Lin Bao to the banquet in the name of the Zhaos. By doing so, we reveal the operation of Lin Bao, and they won't take reckless moves. The Yangzhou Aristocrats will have to pick our side.",
"challengeStoryDesc2070":"Terrific. What a great idea. I'm on it.",
"challengeStoryDesc2071":"[When you are gonna find Zhao Kang in the warehouse, soliciting his advice for a formal banquet. There comes a familiar voice from out of the hall.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2072":"Butler! Butler! Where's Kang? Where's my son?",
"challengeStoryDesc2073":"Master! Master! Slow it down! Young Master is fine! But why are you back?",
"challengeStoryDesc2074":"[Upon hearing the voice of Zhao An, you make an eye contact with Su Qi'er, bewildered by his return to Yangzhou.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2075":"[And before you get out to see what's it all about, loud and rude knocks come from behind the gate.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2076":"Hey! Get out! And tell! Did a gown man run in just now?",
"challengeStoryDesc2077":"[The bandits got a peg brought down from your beating. They don't ask no more, but turn around and run away.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2078":"Alright. Let's go back to see how Master Zhao managed to run from Hangzhou alone, no, with those bandits.",
"challengeStoryDesc2079":"[You shut the door, return to the hall and see Zhao An inquiring the butler for Zhao Kang.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2080":"[Zhao An looks up upon hearing the door pushed open and catches you coming in. He burst out crying before you even ask.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2081":"Your Highness, do save my son!",
"challengeStoryDesc2082":"Zhao An, why did you return to Yangzhou? Did Prince Baylor know that?",
"challengeStoryDesc2083":"[Your question renders Zhao An evasive. But as a contrast, the butler replies with a tough tone, as if he had received reliable support.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2084":"It's our mansion. And our Master owns the mansion. He comes and goes as he pleases.",
"challengeStoryDesc2085":"[Zhao An waves his hand to interrupt the butler.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2086":"Lords, I was so worried about my son that I felt it necessary to check on him. You are fully aware of the ferocity of Lin Bao. This old man in front of you had only one son. How can I not worry about him!",
"challengeStoryDesc2087":"But how did you avoid the bandits and get inside the city?",
"challengeStoryDesc2088":"Well...there are a few paths known to the natives only. Besides, there are secret tunnels built in the previous dynasty, which is not in the knowledge of the bandits.",
"challengeStoryDesc2089":"[Then Liu Yong's laughter lightens up the awkward mood.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2090":"Look, Mr. Zhao, you name has been known for too long. You did return in a good timing, for we are at a loss how to cope with Lin Bao. You are a timely help indeed.",
"challengeStoryDesc2091":"[Zhao An shows his stance immediately.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2092":"Rest assured, Your Highness, Lin Bao is an unscrupulous and unforgivable sinner. You may use my help if need be.",
"challengeStoryDesc2093":"Your understanding is the best thing we could've had. Butler, you will be in charge of the wines and dishes for the banquet. From my memory, Zhao Kang has a whole load of gold and good wines. They surely make the perfect baits.",
"challengeStoryDesc2094":"[Zhao An looks a little stunned. Before he speaks, the butler declines immediately.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2095":"No way! That's not gonna happen!",
"challengeStoryDesc2096":"Butler, you don't get to talk before your master.",
"challengeStoryDesc2097":"[Su Qi'er gets the butler to kneel down before the crowd. Zhao An looks flurried and tries to make peace.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2098":"Mr. Su, easy! Easy! My butler weighs his master over anything else. Don't let that get on your nerve!",
"challengeStoryDesc2099":"[Ji Xiaolan only listens to Zhao An's words instead of giving his response. He doesn't ask until he finds a seat and sits down.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2100":"We were only requesting Mr. Zhao to render some support. We were not forcing him. It's you who got emotional!",
"challengeStoryDesc2101":"But could it be...the windfall of Zhao Kang has been stocked from turnover? Is that why you got emotional?",
"challengeStoryDesc2102":"[The threatening tone of Ji Xiaolan makes Zhao An get down on his knees.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2103":"No! No!",
"challengeStoryDesc2104":"It's just pretending to entertain the minions of Lin Bao. And after three rounds of toasts, we put some sleeping pills in the wines. You do know how to throw up a banquet, don't you?",
"challengeStoryDesc2105":"Still, in order that Lin Bao bites the bait, Mr. Zhao should have seconds thoughts about how much gold he's gonna offer.",
"challengeStoryDesc2106":"Only by doing so can we minimize the loss from the capture of Lin Bao and ensure the safety of the Zhaos. Simply put, money paid is misfortune avoided.",
"challengeStoryDesc2107":"[Even if you have emphasized the gravity of situation, Zhao An is still fighting with his worries, as if there were something untold.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2108":"In light of the safety of the Zhaos, the capture of Lin Bao and the atonement for mistakes, the money is well spent. However...",
"challengeStoryDesc2109":"[You know that you can get nothing from Zhao An, so you decide to go find Zhao Kang, known as the Gold Treasury.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2110":"Now that you keep the secret to yourself, I have to turn to Zhao Kang who is currently the court's wanted man. Life or money, I guess it won't be a difficult choice.",
"challengeStoryDesc2111":"Your Highness, I can recall that according to the butler, Zhao Kang seems to be sleeping with the gold in the warehouse all day long.",
"challengeStoryDesc2112":"Your Highness, I know where the warehouse is located. Let me show you the way.",
"challengeStoryDesc2113":"Please, Mr. Ji.",
"challengeStoryDesc2114":"[When you are ready to go to the warehouse, Zhao An comes to stop you suddenly.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2115":"Wait a moment please, your Excellency.",
"challengeStoryDesc2116":"[Zhao An beats around bushes, as if he were hiding something unspeakable.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2117":"Mr. Zhao, what is it that you stopped me for?",
"challengeStoryDesc2118":"I'm so indebted to you for your kind help. Everything...everything goes as you say.",
"challengeStoryDesc2119":"[You make an eye contact with Ji Xiaolan, both knowing there is a secret behind this.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2120":"If so, what's with that anxious look? Tell me your secret, if any, for nothing outweighs the capture of Lin Bao.",
"challengeStoryDesc2121":"Nothing. I...I don't have no secret. I will do whatever you say.",
"challengeStoryDesc2122":"Hmph, secret? Plain truth that he hates to part with the money!",
"challengeStoryDesc2123":"Your Highness, I have an idea. Now that Lin Bao wants the Zhaos, why don't we just get out of here and watch Lin Bao and the Zhaos collide?",
"challengeStoryDesc2124":"[You know clearly that Su Qi'er said that on purpose. You respond with a faint smile and silence.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2125":"[Zhao An believes you have adopted Su Qi'er's advice and feels at a loss.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2126":"Your Highness, the money is not a big deal. You give the order and I'll take care of the rest!",
"challengeStoryDesc2127":"Your Highness, my force is vastly outnumbered by Lin Bao. Given the Zhaos has been granted the grace of His Majesty, I beseech you to save us!",
"challengeStoryDesc2128":"[Knowing that Zhao An has been instilled in the fear, you speak in a composed manner.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2129":"Mr. Zhao, the grace of His Majesty is your blessing or not your protection. We reach out to you, not for you, but for the elimination of Lin Bao. Do you understand?",
"challengeStoryDesc2130":"Yes… Yes…",
"challengeStoryDesc2131":"That's good. I don't care about your secret. But I want to make this clear to you. Tomorrow, in case of any flaw in the plan, it will be you instead of us to bear the brunt first.",
"challengeStoryDesc2132":"I'll save my breath from now. You are clever enough to know what's in your best interest.",
"challengeStoryDesc2133":"[Zhao An reads what you meant, wetting his back instantly.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2134":"Yes. I understand..",
"challengeStoryDesc2135":"It's terrific that you understand. So the capture of Lin Bao tomorrow will count on you.",
"challengeStoryDesc2136":"Lords, please rest assured. I...I will do my best.",
"challengeStoryDesc2137":"[You are about to leave when you hear a mild footstep outside.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2138":"[Su Qi'er rushes out before you order.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2139":"[Su Qi'er hunts down the spying bandit.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2140":"He does work for Lin Bao. Was he here to collect the intelligence on the countermeasure of the Zhaos? Guess Li Bao knows that the Zhaos won't resign itself to the mercy of him.",
"challengeStoryDesc2141":"I wonder how much information he has collected. Anyway, he may not leave here.",
"challengeStoryDesc2142":"Mr. Zhao will ground him. A sure thing, isn't it?",
"challengeStoryDesc2143":"Yes, I will keep him under close watch. You may rest assured.",
"challengeStoryDesc2144":"Somebody, take the bandit to the bottom of the dungeon. Reinforce the guards!",
"challengeStoryDesc2145":"[After you left, Zhao An sits down and breathes out a sigh of tiredness.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2146":"Alas, kids are debt...",
"challengeStoryDesc2147":"Master, they promised to sentence Young Master during the Southern Tour of His Majesty. You served as the reading partner of His Majesty and upon your plea, Young Master...Young Master will be fine.",
"challengeStoryDesc2148":"That's not what I worry about. It's only that the tomorrow's capture of Lin Bao will need tons of Silver Ingots. The budget has always been in the charge Kang. So I have no idea where the Silver Ingots are deposited.",
"challengeStoryDesc2149":"Think of Su Qi'er, the fierce-looking dog. If they knew that the Ingots are in the hand of Kang, they may well give that a context. You are with Kang when he checks the accounts. So do you, by any chance, know where the Ingots are?",
"challengeStoryDesc2150":"Master, you know Young Master...I have no authority to access to such confidential information...",
"challengeStoryDesc2151":"It makes sense. Well, you go find Kang in the warehouse with my private seal. Do crack the whereabouts out of him. And you let him know that the Zhaos will perish tomorrow if he won't tell.",
"challengeStoryDesc2152":"Aye. I get it. I'll be on my way.",
"challengeStoryDesc2153":"[The butler leaves in a hurry. Zhao An seems to be relieved a little and picks up the tea cup on the table for a sip. Before he even sips, he hears a flurries of noise from outside.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2154":"Now what? The noise is driving me nuts!",
"challengeStoryDesc2155":"Master! Master! There come several drunken men, claiming to be your relatives.",
"challengeStoryDesc2156":"What? They work for Lin Bao? That's...",
"challengeStoryDesc2157":"You! Go find the Top Talent! They can't be far away from here by now! You will be in real trouble if you don't return with them!",
"challengeStoryDesc2158":"Aye! Aye! I'm on it!",
"challengeStoryDesc2159":"[The guards race to you before you walk some distance away. And you are informed of the news.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2160":"[In order that the tomorrow's capture of Lin Bao runs smoothly, you hurry back to the Zhaos.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2161":"Look at these drunken bandits. They can't be here for intelligence. They might try their luck on wealth.",
"challengeStoryDesc2162":"That explains. Now that they are here, we'll just keep them lest our plan should get disrupted.",
"challengeStoryDesc2163":"[After consultation, you order Su Qi'er to bring down the few drunken men.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2164":"[After that, Zhao An orders his servants to put them in the dungeon.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2165":"You may rest assured. The dungeon is a solid prison. They can't flee away by a long shot.",
"challengeStoryDesc2166":"Oh, Mr. Zhao's dungeon, it surely has our confidence.",
"challengeStoryDesc2167":"The capture of Lin Bao is crucial. To ensure the smooth running of the plan, we may as well deduce our moves for to.",
"challengeStoryDesc2168":"[So you does to guarantee the complete success.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2169":"[After the deduction, you leave the Zhaos again.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2170":"[Su Qi'er seems to have words in his throat.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2171":"Clearly Zhao An has something on mind. Could not affect the plan?",
"challengeStoryDesc2172":"Don't worry, Mr. Su. The Zhaos are a stakeholder here. He can't be that foolish!",
"challengeStoryDesc2173":"You have a good point there. Apart from that, Zhao An worries about his son only. And His Majesty will have his judgment in the end.",
"challengeStoryDesc2174":"[Your conversation with Ji Xiaolan seems to cast away the doubt of Su Qi'er.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2175":"[The second morning, when you just put your feet in the Zhaos, you see the guards hurrying over.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2176":"Ma...Master! Lin Bao..Lin Bao's men have arrived at the city gate of Yangzhou!",
"challengeStoryDesc2177":"Save your panic! How many times do I have to tell you? Go arrange the banquet as I instructed.",
"challengeStoryDesc2178":"Butler, the Ingots I asked you to fetch from Kang, they are ready, right?",
"challengeStoryDesc2179":"Please rest assured, they are all ready. Reluctant as Young Master is, he sympathizes with the suffering of the Zhaos...",
"challengeStoryDesc2180":"Oh, dear Kang...",
"challengeStoryDesc2181":"[You've heard that Lin Bao has entered the city and you fear that Lin Bao's men will harass the local people. So you request Su Qi'er to check it out.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2182":"The bandits were not that unbridled in the absence of Lin Bao a few days ago. Now that Lin Bao has arrived, the devils are gonna come out and play. I'd like you to check it out and act as you deem fit.",
"challengeStoryDesc2183":"If I leave, your safety...",
"challengeStoryDesc2184":"Won't be a problem. Before the transfer of money, the Zhaos are friends of Lin Bao. They will not make trouble here. Don't worry about that.",
"challengeStoryDesc2185":"Aye. Please rest assured, Your Highness. I won't fail you.",
"challengeStoryDesc2186":"[Just as you expected, Su Qi'er catches a bandit kicking the door of a family before he arrives at the city gate.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2187":"Woman, open the door. I saw you selling the flowers the other day. They were Beautiful, but not much as you are...",
"challengeStoryDesc2188":"The way I see it, you quit selling the flowers, 'cause I will pay for them and all.",
"challengeStoryDesc2189":"You shameless. Take that!",
"challengeStoryDesc2190":"[After Su Qi'er brings down the bandit, he returns to the Zhaos to report to you.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2191":"Just as you expected, Your Highness, Lin Bao's men are harassing the local people. Given their large number, I may not make much difference.",
"challengeStoryDesc2192":"[You try to comfort Su Qi'er who looks more than indignant.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2193":"Chill, Mr. Su. I've had an idea. Mr. Zhao, why don't you pick up Lin Bao personally and lead them to your mansion, so that the local people can avoid them.",
"challengeStoryDesc2194":"[Before Zhao An says anything, the butler wears an unpleasant look.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2195":"Our Master is a court official. He may throw up a banquet for Lin Bao, but he won't deign himself to greet the bunch of bastards for those untouchables.",
"challengeStoryDesc2196":"[You respond to his prevarication with a brittle laugh.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2197":"Court official? Untouchables? It is the Untouchables you refer to that makes your Master a court official!",
"challengeStoryDesc2198":"Mr. Zhao, your butler is talking big! I wonder if you are thinking alike.",
"challengeStoryDesc2199":"[Zhao An tries to soothe your anger.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2200":"He was being rude. But please forgive him for that. Your order will my full-strength support. And it won't be a problem for me to pick up Lin Bao. It's only that Lin Bao's men look like fierce beasts. I'm afraid...",
"challengeStoryDesc2201":"Don't be. Mr. Su will escort you as your bodyguard. I bet you are assured of the abilities of Mr. Su.",
"challengeStoryDesc2202":"That being the case, I hope that won't add too much trouble to Mr. Su.",
"challengeStoryDesc2203":"[Reluctant as Zhao An is, he still sets out to pick up Lin Bao. Su Qi'er goes with him in the accompanying escorts, heading towards the city gate.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2204":"[Somewhere near the gate, Zhao An's delegation meets Lin Bao. Zhao An has no intention to make him feel slighted. So he picks up the pace and bows to Lin Bao.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2205":"Brother Lin, I specially come to greet you for your arrival.",
"challengeStoryDesc2206":"Zhao An, you are someone with glasses! I'll cut the crap. You know why I am here. So turn in everything that has a price!",
"challengeStoryDesc2207":"[Lin Bao isn't being polite, which irritates one guard with the Zhaos. A minion with Lin Bao happens to see that.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2208":"Hey, what's with that look? You should feel honored to earn Mr. Lin's appreciation! Don't be a smartass!",
"challengeStoryDesc2209":"[Several bandits deal blows to the guard at the same time. At this critical moment, Su Qi'er comes to his aid.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2210":"[Su Qi'er saves the guard. Yet Lin Bao is not happy at all to see that.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2211":"Zhao An, what do you mean by that? Don't play your temper on me. You are supposed to pick me up.",
"challengeStoryDesc2212":"[At the sight of Lin Bao, Zhao An hurries to comfort him with words.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2213":"You small fries, how dare you raise hands to the subordinates of Mr. Lin? You can't bear any consequence, should you get them hurt? A bunch of good-for-nothings, you will have your punishments when we return to mansion!",
"challengeStoryDesc2214":"Brother Lin, don't let that get under your skin. I will teach a good lesson to these brats. But you are so magnanimous a man that you won't fuss over these losers.",
"challengeStoryDesc2215":"[The sweet words of Zhao An do work on Lin Bao.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2216":"Hmph. Forget it. I came here to attend my business. These minions aren't worth my breaths.",
"challengeStoryDesc2217":"Brother Lin, look, we could've found you a better place. The Zhaos and other aristocrats in Yangzhou have prepared some welcoming gifts. Would you like to make a transfer to the banquet, despite your distinguished standing？",
"challengeStoryDesc2218":"[Upon hearing the welcoming gifts, there appears greediness in the eyes of Lin Bao. Zhao An then strikes while the iron is hot.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2219":"Not knowing your preferences, we prepared you gold and silver instead of gems and jades. Could you please give us the honor by just being in our mansion where you can check them out?",
"challengeStoryDesc2220":"[Lin Bao looks even more thrilled.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2221":"Haha. Now that you invited me, I'd better do as Romans say. Everyone, we shall go visit the Zhaos!",
"challengeStoryDesc2222":"[The order of Lin Bao has sent the entire bandits into raptures. They quicken the pace towards the Zhaos.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2223":"[And the successful invitation somewhat reassures Zhao An and Su Qi'er.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2224":"[When Su Qi'er is gonna hide in the guards, he suddenly feels a blast of air from behind.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2225":"Urgh. That works for Mr. Lin, not for me. You hit my brother. I wanna see what you got!",
"challengeStoryDesc2226":"[Subtly, Su Qi'er takes an upper hand over the bandit.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2227":"Why are you being so aggressive when Mr. Lin has let it go? Do you have or not the due respect for Mr. Lin?",
"challengeStoryDesc2228":"[The fight of the two draws the attention of Lin Bao. Lin Bao scans it and knows what's it all about. Perhaps it is his light mood from the wealth that dampens the anger.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2229":"Behave yourselves. You will have green lights to the Ladies' Street after I conclude my business.",
"challengeStoryDesc2230":"[Lin Bao's words maintain the order. The bandit snorts as he leaves.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2231":"[Lin Bao and others arrive at the Zhaos. Su Qi'er nods to you stealthily, implying that everything's okay.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2232":"Butler! Butler! Go fetch the gifts for Mr. Lin!",
"challengeStoryDesc2233":"Aye! I'm on it!",
"challengeStoryDesc2234":"[Soon, the butler returns with dozens of servants following, each holding one tray covered with red cloth.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2235":"Brother Lin, here are your welcoming gifts. Please kindly accept these little presents.",
"challengeStoryDesc2236":"[Lin Bao unveils the red cloth, revealing stacks of glittering Silver Ingots.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2237":"Thank you, Zhao An. Nonetheless, they are indeed [little presents].",
"challengeStoryDesc2238":"Please hold your horse, mister. In the backyard, we are registering and loading the precious tributes from different aristocrats, as an effort to facilitate your future delivery to Mount Zhongyi.",
"challengeStoryDesc2239":"[Lin Bao looks over and sees all sorts of jewels, gems and jades in the backyard. He looks satisfied and thrilled.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2240":"You are a clever man, Zhao An. Brothers, let's go. To the backyard. And to our rewards for today!",
"challengeStoryDesc2241":"Brothers, move!",
"challengeStoryDesc2242":"Heehee. It's never wrong to follow Brother Lin!",
"challengeStoryDesc2243":"[At the sight of the bandits getting even more emotional, Su Qi'er walks up for your protection.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2244":"Look out!",
"challengeStoryDesc2245":"[You give a loud cough when these bandits are rushing to the backyard, reminding Zhao An to not forget today's plan.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2246":"[Master, the registration is still ongoing. The rush of the ministers, might...might...]",
"challengeStoryDesc2247":"[Zhao An takes your hint and comes up to stop Lin Bao.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2248":"[Lin Bao looks very annoyed when stopped by Zhao An.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2249":"Zhao An, what's with you? Could it be that I need your permission before I enter the backyard?",
"challengeStoryDesc2250":"Brother Lin, you might be joking. You are our distinguished guest. And you may tread anywhere as you please.",
"challengeStoryDesc2251":"If so, why are you in my way? Get lost!",
"challengeStoryDesc2252":"Easy, Brother Lin. The registration work is still ongoing in the backyard. Those gems and jades are all there just for you. If your brothers rush in and accidentally break something priceless, that will be your loss.",
"challengeStoryDesc2253":"[Upon the thought that these jewels and gems will be his possession soon, Lin Bao begins to cherish his treasures and look somewhat calm.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2254":"[At the sight of the calm look of Lin Bao adds Zhao An.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2255":"It must have been a long journey for the brothers from Mount Zhongyi. We have prepared the dishes. May I invite you and all brothers to deign yourselves to the banquet, so the Yangzhou Aristocrats may earn respect from the locals?",
"challengeStoryDesc2256":"[Zhao An's words sound gratifying to Lin Bao.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2257":"Wines and dishes of Xichun Restaurant? That costs like hell. You are being very hospitable, Mr. Zhao.",
"challengeStoryDesc2258":"It's not a big deal compared with that honor. Brother Lin and all other brothers, while you are waiting, I'm gonna tell them the banquet is on.",
"challengeStoryDesc2259":"[Zhao An trots to the backyard for a discussion with you.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2260":"The sleeping pills...now?",
"challengeStoryDesc2261":"No, not now. Serve the normal first.",
"challengeStoryDesc2262":"It bothers me very much whether the pill will do the miracle...",
"challengeStoryDesc2263":"[Hardly has Zhao An's voice died away, there come the footsteps from outside.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2264":"A bandit in the backyard!",
"challengeStoryDesc2265":"[Within two or three moves, Su Qi'er knocks out the bandit.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2266":"Your Highness, should we put the bandit in the dungeon?",
"challengeStoryDesc2267":"Nope. Lin Bao is at the front yard. And we might cause noises by doing so. For safety's sake, we'll wait.",
"challengeStoryDesc2268":"Your Highness, now that the bandit has passed out, we may just leave him alone. But why did you suggest me not drugging now. Isn't it much better if we can bring down Lin Bao with one move?",
"challengeStoryDesc2269":"Lin Bao is a suspicious guy. Otherwise he couldn't have stood for so many years. These gems and jades can only buy his trust in part.",
"challengeStoryDesc2270":"Mr. Zhao, later, you will be attending the banquet with Lin Bao. If he is suspicious of the dishes, you try them first. Our top priority is let down his guard.",
"challengeStoryDesc2271":"[Ji Xiaolan nods as he appreciates what you've said.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2272":"How considerate of Top Talent. If Lin Bao were to be told to attend the banquet alone, he may well assume that something's up.",
"challengeStoryDesc2273":"Right. When Lin Bao is stuffed with wines and foods, and when his mind wanders, we will proceed with our next step. Mr. Zhao, everything's counting on you.",
"challengeStoryDesc2274":"[Having heard what you say, Zhao An has to follow your advice.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2275":"Well then, I'm all yours. It's only that...the bandits of Lin Bao...I...oh...",
"challengeStoryDesc2276":"[You read Zhao An's concerns and you comfort him with words.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2277":"Please rest assured, Mr. Zhao. Lin Bao is not a reckless guy. He will not put a finger on you before he gets the treasures from the Zhaos.",
"challengeStoryDesc2278":"Besides, we will be disguising ourselves as guests in the name of the Yangzhou Aristocrats. Mr. Zhao is the key to this plan and we will keep you safe and sound.",
"challengeStoryDesc2279":"[Your words seem to have reassured Zhao An.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2280":"Then, I really appreciate you for that.",
"challengeStoryDesc2281":"[The bandit on the ground opens his eyes like in a maze when Zhao An is prepared to leave.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2282":"You...It's you!",
"challengeStoryDesc2283":"[After the bandit is brought down, Zhao An gives a long sigh, as if having made up his mind.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2284":"I'll go install Lin Bao in the front yard. And I'd like to bother you by putting him in the dungeon.",
"challengeStoryDesc2285":"For what's coming next in the banquet, I will strictly abide by your plan. And the capture of Lin Bao, it's all on you!",
"challengeStoryDesc2286":"Sure thing. Don't worry about that, Mr. Zhao.",
"challengeStoryDesc2287":"[Zhao An goes to the backyard and checks on the preparation for the banquet.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2288":"The banquet and the sleeping pills, are they ready?",
"challengeStoryDesc2289":"As instructed by you, Master.",
"challengeStoryDesc2290":"Good. Ask the kitchen to serve the normal dishes first. As for the timing for the drugs, wait for my command.",
"challengeStoryDesc2291":"[Having ordered the butler, Zhao An hurries to meet Lin Bao in the front yard. And Lin Bao looks somewhat impatient already.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2292":"What takes you so long, Mr. Zhao?",
"challengeStoryDesc2293":"Given the honor of your attendance, I find the banquet rare and unique. Seldom have my servants received so important guests. So I have to give proper orders to these men lest anything should go wrong and ruin your mood.",
"challengeStoryDesc2294":"[Those gratifying words seem to work on Lin Bao.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2295":"Zhao An, you are indeed someone with proper sense.",
"challengeStoryDesc2296":"I'm flattered. Now that the banquet is ready, please go take a seat in the Banquet Hall.",
"challengeStoryDesc2297":"[Lin Bao and others are led by Zhao An to the Banquet Hall, and beam with pleasure at the sight of a feast of delicacies from land and sea.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2298":"Zhao An, I appreciate your work.",
"challengeStoryDesc2299":"I am more than pleased to receive your appreciation. But thank you again for your gracious attendance. And your friendship will be my honor and everything that I could've asked for.",
"challengeStoryDesc2300":"[The hospitality of Zhao An adds to the pleasure of Lin Bao.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2301":"Brothers, Mr. Zhao An has prepared an excellent banquet! You just make yourself at home and treat Mr. Zhao as a dear brother!",
"challengeStoryDesc2302":"Aye, as Brother Lin says!",
"challengeStoryDesc2303":"[So speak the bandits in concert. Amid the chaos, a bandit jumps towards a waitress in the hall.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2304":"Beauty, you must be an appetizer served by Zhao An, aren't you?",
"challengeStoryDesc2305":"[You don't wanna see that happen so you signal Su Qi'er.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2306":"[You bring down the bandit who was trying to make trouble. The feast being a mess, Lin Bao doesn't notice you.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2307":"Mr. Su, we gotta be handle it carefully so that Lin Bao won't smell anything fishy.",
"challengeStoryDesc2308":"How considerate of Your Highness. I get it.",
"challengeStoryDesc2309":"[In the Banquet Hall, Zhao An is inviting Lin Bao to take a seat.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2310":"Please take the seat of honor. Not knowing your preferences, I only hope these dishes and wines suit you just fine. And pardon me for any inconvenience.",
"challengeStoryDesc2311":"Haha, you're being too polite.",
"challengeStoryDesc2312":"Your magnanimity is no umbrella for my slackness. I will go check the kitchen to see whether those little bastards are loafing on the job.",
"challengeStoryDesc2313":"[Lin Bao plucks at Zhao An.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2314":"Mr. Zhao, your management leaves much to be desired. Do you have to seek accountability as a master yourself?",
"challengeStoryDesc2315":"Brother Lin's banquet anything but ordinary. Any slackness may well ruin it. It's better I take a look personally.",
"challengeStoryDesc2316":"Hmph, a lazy servant shall be sentenced to death. Why waist your energy?",
"challengeStoryDesc2317":"Just stay. You don't look like a poor drinker. Join the drink with me!",
"challengeStoryDesc2318":"[Upon the reflection of what you said, Zhao An knows that Lin Bao has become suspicious, so he doesn't bother to find him an excuse.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2319":"[Now that Brother Lin has deigned to drink with me, I will be being pain in the ass if I decline.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2320":"[Lin Bao laughs and pats the shoulder of Zhao An.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2321":"Mr. Zhao is smart enough not to be pain in the ass. C'mon, cut the crap and drink!",
"challengeStoryDesc2322":"[You feel reassured from the observation of Zhao An sitting down, only to be confronted with a bandit from nowhere.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2323":"Hey, what ya doin'? The feast is designed for Brother Lin. You strangers get lost!",
"challengeStoryDesc2324":"[The noise here seems to disturb Lin Bao. To cover you, Zhao An speaks to attract his attention.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2325":"Brother Lin, it's the top-grade Dukang Wine from Xichun Restaurant. Can this thirty-year-old wine win your favor?",
"challengeStoryDesc2326":"[The aromatic wine draws the attention of Lin Bao right away.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2327":"[Zhao An picks up the kettle and pours himself a cup and another for Lin Bao.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2328":"[Seeing that Lin Bao doesn't drink for a while, Zhao An picks up his cup first.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2329":"[It's the honor of the Zhaos and Yangzhou that Brother Lin attends the banquet. As a host, I will drink it first on behalf of the Yangzhou Aristocrats.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2330":"[Zhao An knows that Lin Bao has not cast away his doubt completely, so he pours himself another cup.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2331":"The house is graced with your presence, brothers from Mount Zhongyi. I, Zhao An, propose a toast to all of you. Thank you for giving me the honor.",
"challengeStoryDesc2332":"[At the sight of another empty cup in the hand of Zhao An, Lin Bao's eyebrows stretch.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2333":"Brothers, with that hospitality, you're gonna rock the house. Salute to Mr. Zhao.",
"challengeStoryDesc2334":"Great! It's never wrong to follow Brother Lin!",
"challengeStoryDesc2335":"[The exulting bandits are licensing themselves to enjoy the feast.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2336":"[Doubt being cast away, Lin Bao begins to savor the food and wines.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2337":"Brother Lin, please feel free to tell me anything you desire for the dishes.",
"challengeStoryDesc2338":"Great! Wonderful. You are a good friend of mine!",
"challengeStoryDesc2339":"[You sit down in a corner, waiting for your moment.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2340":"[A drunken bandit stumbles to you.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2341":"Hey, you! Which camp are you with? You don't look familiar...",
"challengeStoryDesc2342":"Mmm...Forget it, I don't care about whichever camp. Join me to drink!",
"challengeStoryDesc2343":"Sorry, we are cheap drunks...",
"challengeStoryDesc2344":"Then why are you here? Beat it!",
"challengeStoryDesc2345":"[The noise disturbs Lin Bao again.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2346":"What's the noise? Give me a break to drink, will you?",
"challengeStoryDesc2347":"You strangers, who are you?",
"challengeStoryDesc2348":"[At the sight of Lin Bao getting alarmed, Zhao An stands up for mediation.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2349":"Brother Lin, rein in your anger please. They are with the Yangzhou Aristocrats. In case that Brother Lin should have words with the Yangzhou Aristocrats, I asked for their presence.",
"challengeStoryDesc2350":"[Lin Bao stills wears a gloomy countenance.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2351":"Zhao An, I was asking them, not you!",
"challengeStoryDesc2352":"You blockheads. Waiting for me to ask you again?",
"challengeStoryDesc2353":"[You stand up at the sight of the angry Lin Bao, pretending to be frightened.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2354":"Re...report to Mr. Lin, we were...ur...wanted by Mr. Zhao. I mean...to your companion for the feast. We're...ur...",
"challengeStoryDesc2355":"[Your timidness is such a nuisance to Lin Bao that he waves hands impatiently.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2356":"You can't even utter a complete sentence, can you?",
"challengeStoryDesc2357":"Zhao An, impressive that you found these good-for-nothings.",
"challengeStoryDesc2358":"They are simply frightened by your majesty. Well, it's your formidable pressure to blame.",
"challengeStoryDesc2359":"Urgh. Somebody, kick them out!",
"challengeStoryDesc2360":"[You pretend to be injured by the bandits.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2361":"Young Master, Young Master, are you okay?",
"challengeStoryDesc2362":"Ow...Ow...my arms...they must be broken...",
"challengeStoryDesc2363":"Stop whining. The subordinates of Mr. Lin are walking you out. Are you not satisfied?",
"challengeStoryDesc2364":"You were brought here to add some fun here. Never expected you to be buzzkillers. You have to be grateful for Mr. Lin's magnanimity. Don't be a smartass. Just get out of here!",
"challengeStoryDesc2365":"[Knowing that Zhao An is making an excuse for you, you make an apology to Lin Bao.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2366":"Mr...Mr. Lin, we're...sorry that we've ruined your mood. We'll...ur...be on our way...",
"challengeStoryDesc2367":"[Lin Bao drinks his wine without even looking at you.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2368":"Beat it. A bunch of losers. Don't you ruin my feast again!",
"challengeStoryDesc2369":"C'mon, Mr. Zhao, let's drink!",
"challengeStoryDesc2370":"I was being inconsiderate. They were here to please you. I never saw that coming. My bad. I will drink three cups as an apology.",
"challengeStoryDesc2371":"Haha, never mind! I like your manners, Mr. Zhao.",
"challengeStoryDesc2372":"[At the sight of Lin Bao getting distracted by Zhao An, you hurries to step down from the side door.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2373":"[Now, another drunken bandit walks towards you.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2374":"Hey, hey, lo..losers! We'll...have fun...playing!",
"challengeStoryDesc2375":"[Su Qi'er stands up in your protection.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2376":"[After bringing down the drunken bandit, you finally break free from the banquet safely.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2377":"The plan on Zhao An's part has been running smoothly. It won't be a problem if we leave the banquet. We can discuss the following actions.",
"challengeStoryDesc2378":"[Su Qi'er seems indignant.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2379":"How bold is Lin Bao! A bandit should be so rude to Your Highness!",
"challengeStoryDesc2380":"Do I get the permission, Your Highness, to sneak into the banquet and slay Lin Bao to crucify the bandits?",
"challengeStoryDesc2381":"[You stop Su Qi'er as you deem it not fit.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2382":"Freeze! Sober up! It remains unknown whether you can assassinate Lin Bao. But if you do, how are you gonna cope with the bandits under his leadership?",
"challengeStoryDesc2383":"With you abilities, we two can definitely get out of there safe and sound. But what about the local people in Yangzhou?",
"challengeStoryDesc2384":"We are officers of His Majesty, with the court's salary and at the court's service. We cannot think about of ourselves only! Your obtrusion will be your Achilles 'heel!",
"challengeStoryDesc2385":"[Su Qi'er feels somewhat embarrassed upon hearing what you've said.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2386":"Your Highness, you have a point there. I was being obtrusive.",
"challengeStoryDesc2387":"That's in part because of me. I am so indebted to you for your saving me multiple times. A man knows when to lay low and walk tall. For the sake of the local people in Yangzhou, the temporary disgrace means nothing to me.",
"challengeStoryDesc2388":"Your moral integrity has my admiration.",
"challengeStoryDesc2389":"Mr. Su, I'm flattered. Now, we will work out our step.",
"challengeStoryDesc2390":"Lin Bao has let down his guard. Still, he got a large force of men. For safety's sake, we have to siege the Zhaos first lest any criminal should get away.",
"challengeStoryDesc2391":"Speaking of sieging the Zhaos, it's time for Brother to play.",
"challengeStoryDesc2392":"[There comes a gentle laugh from the wall in the middle of your discussion.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2393":"[You two are surprised to recognize the guy to be Shan Ji.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2394":"Brother! Speaking of devil!",
"challengeStoryDesc2395":"Haha, our reunion can wait. But we will finish the tail first.",
"challengeStoryDesc2396":"[Together with Shan Ji, you defeat the bandit who stalked him.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2397":"The man's with Lin Bao, right?",
"challengeStoryDesc2398":"Right. A guy placed around the Zhaos by Lin Bao. He followed me as he noticed my entering into the mansion.",
"challengeStoryDesc2399":"Well, I thought you won't be here until the night. You've arrived early!",
"challengeStoryDesc2400":"I heard that Yangzhou is in a curfew. In light of Lin Bao's attack, I whipped the horse hard to come to your aid. How's it going now?",
"challengeStoryDesc2401":"Everything goes as planned. Lin Bao has let down his guard. And the banquet in the hall is about to culminate with our further moves.",
"challengeStoryDesc2402":"My soldiers have made it to Yangzhou with me and are now lurking around the Zhaos. If you deem fit, your signal will be my order to siege the Zhaos.",
"challengeStoryDesc2403":"That couln't be better. Before we siege the Zhaos, we have another thing to attend to.",
"challengeStoryDesc2404":"What is it?",
"challengeStoryDesc2405":"The main force of the bandits are now in the the banquet. But Lin Bao deployed some men to guard the mansion as he entered. If we don't dispatch our soldiers beforehand, it will be the end of the everything.",
"challengeStoryDesc2406":"If so, let's purify the bandits.",
"challengeStoryDesc2407":"The bandits won't be a problem except for those guarding on the front and rear door. Lin Bao placed his household guards and they are the top priority.",
"challengeStoryDesc2408":"It's typical of you to sail safely. We'll do as you say.",
"challengeStoryDesc2409":"[After the discussion, you walk towards the front door together.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2410":"Stay alert when you take the moves. Don't alarm the snakes.",
"challengeStoryDesc2411":"[You defeated the bandits guarding the front door without much effort.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2412":"Everyone, hold your breath as much as possible. Stay away from their sights and hearings.",
"challengeStoryDesc2413":"Brother, please give the signal to summon your soldiers. Let them guard the front door first.",
"challengeStoryDesc2414":"[Shan Ji asks his household guards to assign the mission.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2415":"Now that the front door guards have been eliminated. We will be on the way to the rear door.",
"challengeStoryDesc2416":"Lin Bao must have other arrangements somewhere else. It's only that we don't have the time for detailed investigation. We can only wait till the deployment of Brother's soldiers. Now, we will act according to circumstances.",
"challengeStoryDesc2417":"[The moment you walk to the mansion, you catch a soldier trotting by and reporting to Shan Ji.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2418":"Everyone, my soldiers will be summoned here in full real soon.",
"challengeStoryDesc2419":"Brother, please send some soldiers to guard around the Zhaos. No passing in or out. Still, don't send soldiers to the rear door yet, for the spies haven't been eliminated.",
"challengeStoryDesc2420":"You've been always careful. When we clear the bandits at the back door, we will place our men there.",
"challengeStoryDesc2421":"Lin Bao could never have expected that the mansion will be under our control.",
"challengeStoryDesc2422":"Right, Brother, I suggest you screening those bandits around. Make sure every single of them is captured, lest any information should get leaked to Lin Bao.",
"challengeStoryDesc2423":"Understood. Consider that done.",
"challengeStoryDesc2424":"[After Shan Ji leaves, you continue to head towards the back door of the Zhaos.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2425":"Alas, Brother Lin took them to the feast, leaving us in a fever...",
"challengeStoryDesc2426":"Stop whining. We are here for a reason. Brother Lin needs us here!",
"challengeStoryDesc2427":"[While the bandits are chatting, you approach them stealthily.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2428":"[Having brought down the spies at the back door, you see Shan Ji return.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2429":"As you said, I have given the order. The mansion is now sieged by our soldiers. Front door and the rear door are under watch so close that no one may pass in or out.",
"challengeStoryDesc2430":"Thank you, Brother. So you have gained the control of the entire mansion.",
"challengeStoryDesc2431":"According to your plan, I wonder if it's show time for Mr. Zhao.",
"challengeStoryDesc2432":"[As agreed, you go to the kitchen and meet the butler there.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2433":"Lords, may I ask if we're gonna take the next move.",
"challengeStoryDesc2434":"Correct. We have deposited the sleeping pills in the kitchen. Please notify Mr. Zhao that the main dishes designed for Mr. Lin have been ready. It's only that the chief has forgotten the family-inherited recipe.",
"challengeStoryDesc2435":"Aye, I...I'm on my way.",
"challengeStoryDesc2436":"[The butler hurries to the Banquet Hall, informing Zhao An of your message.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2437":"Master, according to the kitchen, the main dishes designed for Mr. Lin have been ready. It's only that the chief has forgotten the family-inherited recipe. So Master, you gotta enter the warehouse and fetch the recipe.",
"challengeStoryDesc2438":"[Zhao An reads what the butler means, knowing everything is ready and feeling a twitch of heart.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2439":"Forgotten what? A bunch of blockheads. Good-for-nothings! They should've been kicked out but for the feast for Brother Lin!",
"challengeStoryDesc2440":"Brother Lin, I was intended to serve you main dishes. But I never saw it coming that I have to check out these good-for-nothings. Please wait a sec. I will be right back.",
"challengeStoryDesc2441":"[Tipsy Lin Bao waves his hands impatiently.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2442":"Off you go..Go! Not a bad drinker you are. Do come back quick! For another round!",
"challengeStoryDesc2443":"Aye, please suit yourself. I'll be back real soon.",
"challengeStoryDesc2444":"[Zhao An hurries to the kitchen, meeting you there.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2445":"Lords, is everything ready now?",
"challengeStoryDesc2446":"[Now that the mansion has been sieged by our soldiers, you may drug Lin Bao now.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2447":"Alright, I'll give them the order and...Who's there!",
"challengeStoryDesc2448":"[There comes the voice of the butler.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2449":"Sir, you may not go in there!",
"challengeStoryDesc2450":"Hey... I was told about the tasty dishes. I come to have a check, can't I?",
"challengeStoryDesc2451":"[You make an eye contact with Su Qi'er and he opens the door and slips outside.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2452":"[Zhao An seems to be a little nervous.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2453":"You don't have to worry, Mr. Zhao. The mansion is in our hand.",
"challengeStoryDesc2454":"The...the soldiers of General Shan Ji?",
"challengeStoryDesc2455":"Exactly, the soldiers of General Shan Ji, plus the household guards of the mansion. The capture of Lin Bao is like a real snap.",
"challengeStoryDesc2456":"Which prompts the next move extremely important. You may have to refrain yourself from excessive countenances, lest Lin Bao should smell anything fishy.",
"challengeStoryDesc2457":"I...I get it. I will order my servants to put the sleeping pills in the wines and dishes.",
"challengeStoryDesc2458":"We may as well consider it done with your cooperation.",
"challengeStoryDesc2459":"[When Zhao is about to leave, you wink towards Su Qi'er. Su Qi'er reaches his pocket for a small vial and passes it to Zhao An.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2460":"It's..It's?",
"challengeStoryDesc2461":"The antidote of the sleeping pills. After you drug him, Lin Bao may very likely ask you to join him drinking. But the plan can't go without you. So I suggest you taking the antidote first.",
"challengeStoryDesc2462":"[Zhao An receives the antidote, yet looking somewhat hesitant.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2463":"It's okay if you don't believe us, Mr. Zhao. But do think it over. If we want to murder you, we won't bother poisoning you. Besides, we are cooperating on this. That will do me no good.",
"challengeStoryDesc2464":"[Zhao An is convinced by your words. He takes the antidote and walks out to give his order to the servants.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2465":"The old fellow is guarding against us.",
"challengeStoryDesc2466":"When we put a rope on Zhao Kang, Zhao An has taken us as sworn enemies. But for the onslaught of Lin Bao, Zhao An would never have entered the cooperation with us.",
"challengeStoryDesc2467":"It doesn't matter if Zhao An trusts us. Because the capture of Lin Bao is our top priority. As for the personal grudges, let's just wait till the Southern Tour of His Majesty.",
"challengeStoryDesc2468":"Good point there. It's only that we have to be cautious against his dirty moves.",
"challengeStoryDesc2469":"Yes, we will. I wonder how much progress Zhao An has made. Let's go check it out.",
"challengeStoryDesc2470":"[You come out of the room, only to hear a girl screaming in a bush nearby.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2471":"Beauty, don't fight it. From now on...you will worry no more about life...",
"challengeStoryDesc2472":"God damn the bandits!",
"challengeStoryDesc2473":"[Su Qi'er finishes the bandit in a snap and goes to the kitchen for Zhao An.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2474":"Mr. Zhao, how's it going?",
"challengeStoryDesc2475":"They've found the Sleeping Pills in the kitchen and they're about to put them in the wines and dishes.",
"challengeStoryDesc2476":"Hang on a second, Mr. Zhao. Drug a slight amount in the dishes and some in the wines.",
"challengeStoryDesc2477":"Why?",
"challengeStoryDesc2478":"Because the taste of the dishes will be much more affected. Make sure the bandits are numb in tongue and clouded in mind.",
"challengeStoryDesc2479":"Besides, the thick flavor of the wines will drown the perception of the drug. And these half-drunken bandits won't stand a chance.",
"challengeStoryDesc2480":"I am really impressed by the prudent Top Talent.",
"challengeStoryDesc2481":"[Zhao An orders the servants to drug as per your instruction.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2482":"Now, Mr. Zhao, you will be drinking together with Lin Bao. The more they drink, the more it facilitates our next move.",
"challengeStoryDesc2483":"I...get it. I will notify you when the drug works. And then we will count on you in the capture of these bandits.",
"challengeStoryDesc2484":"Please rest assured, Mr. Zhao. We're expecting your good news.",
"challengeStoryDesc2485":"I wanna say thank-you in advance. And I'll be on my way to the Banquet Hall.",
"challengeStoryDesc2486":"Hey, you, keep drugging. You may find more over there, if need be.",
"challengeStoryDesc2487":"[Having ordered the servants, Zhao An sets out for the Banquet Hall.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2488":"[A waitress returns from next to the kitchen with the sleeping pills.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2489":"[All of a sudden, a drunken bandit jumps to her from behind.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2490":"Beauty, I've been following you! What's it in your hands? Hmm...That smells familiar. It's...It's Sleeping...",
"challengeStoryDesc2491":"[Before he finishes the sentence, Su Qi'er pounces towards him and covers his mouth.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2492":"[Zhao An orders the servants to serve the drugged wines to the Banquet Hall.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2493":"Saddle up and put your smiles on. You got no one to save you if those bandits should find something's wrong!",
"challengeStoryDesc2494":"[Zhao An is greeted with a wine cup immediately he returns to the Banquet Hall.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2495":"Zhao An, you were saying you wanted to use the bathroom. What...what kept you so long?",
"challengeStoryDesc2496":"Oh, you must be...planning on something...",
"challengeStoryDesc2497":"[Zhao An comes towards the furious Lin Bao with a smiling face.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2498":"Calm down, Brother Lin. It's all on me. I will drink three cups as an apology.",
"challengeStoryDesc2499":"[Zhao An picks up the wine kettle just served and drinks three cups.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2500":"Everyone is drinking happily, so I bought another batch of Dukang Wine from Xichun Restaurant, which takes some time. I was told that the new batch is fifty-years-old. I hope you like the thickness of the wine.",
"challengeStoryDesc2501":"[Lin Bao looks pleasant with the gratify words of Zhao An.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2502":"Urgh...Alright. You have my...my pardon, given what you've done for me.",
"challengeStoryDesc2503":"How magnanimous you are, Brother Lin!",
"challengeStoryDesc2504":"[Zhao An now orders the servants to pour the drugged wines for the bandits.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2505":"Now that you are here as my distinguished guests, I will treat you like brothers! Please do me the honor to drink this up!",
"challengeStoryDesc2506":"[The entire hall looks like in a mess with these drunken bandits.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2507":"[Zhao An feels more than reassured to see the bandits drinking the drugged wine.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2508":"[All of a sudden, a bandit comes to Zhao An.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2509":"Mr. Zhao...No...Brother Zhao, I wanna propose a toast to you!",
"challengeStoryDesc2510":"[Zhao An looks somewhat unhappy, which the bandit reads with his piercing eyes.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2511":"What...what do you mean by that? You were addressing me your brother...But now...Could it be...that you take me as nothing?",
"challengeStoryDesc2512":"[The bandit pounces upon Zhao An. At this critical moment, a hand reaches over and pulls Zhao An back. It is Su Qi'er.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2513":"[With a few skillful moves of Su Qi'er, the bandit collapses into the ground after several twitches.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2514":"[Zhao An seems to be still shocked. Then he expresses his gratitude for Su Qi'er.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2515":"I'm grateful for that, Su...Mr.Su. Otherwise I could've been...",
"challengeStoryDesc2516":"Don't be. It is the lord who sent me here for information. Besides, no contingencies shall occur to Mr. Zhao right now.",
"challengeStoryDesc2517":"[The cold words of Su Qi'er make Zhao An somewhat awkward.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2518":"Mr. Su, these bandits have drunk the wine. When will the drug work?",
"challengeStoryDesc2519":"Very soon. These sleeping pills never fail.",
"challengeStoryDesc2520":"I was ordered to check the distribution of the bandits in the hall. And I will now report on my mission. Please notify us when the drug works.",
"challengeStoryDesc2521":"Yeah, sure thing.",
"challengeStoryDesc2522":"[After Su Qi'er leaves, Zhao An watches these bandits very closely. Soon, they collapse one after another, with Lin Bao still absorbed in drinking. But obviously, he can't think properly.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2523":"[Zhao An sneaks out of the Banquet All at this point]",
"challengeStoryDesc2524":"Lords, the bandits in the hall, they seem to have fallen asleep, like dead pigs!",
"challengeStoryDesc2525":"How's Lin Bao doing?",
"challengeStoryDesc2526":"Lin Bao seems to be still awake and drinking. But he isn't much sober.",
"challengeStoryDesc2527":"We may as well take actions. Let's begin with the inside of the mansion.",
"challengeStoryDesc2528":"[Shan Ji gives his soldiers the order to enter the mansion.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2529":"Brother, I wonder whether the bandits around the mansion have been all eliminated.",
"challengeStoryDesc2530":"They have searched as per your advice. All fishes are in the net.",
"challengeStoryDesc2531":"Terrific. So now, we're gonna purge the bandits inside.",
"challengeStoryDesc2532":"[The soldiers of Shan Ji enter the mansion squad by squad, with an order to search for the bandits inside.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2533":"[You lead two squads of household soldiers to the Banquet Hall. As soon as you arrive at the atrium, a drunken bandit comes over towards you.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2534":"Hey, where you heading, brothers...Burp...What for?",
"challengeStoryDesc2535":"[You bring down the drunken bandit very easily.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2536":"Lin Bao and others are right in the hall. And here comes the most wonderful part for today.",
"challengeStoryDesc2537":"Your Highness, should we rush inside at one go?",
"challengeStoryDesc2538":"Put aside reckless courage. For safety's sake, the soldiers of Brother will guard around the Banquet Hall lest any fish should flee.",
"challengeStoryDesc2539":"[Shan Ji passes your order onto the soldiers and they soon siege the Banquet Hall.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2540":"The soldiers of Brother are searching for the remnant bandits. Now that we have got the Banquet Hall sieged, they can't possibly escape.",
"challengeStoryDesc2541":"I'm always impressed by your prudence. Given the atrociousness of Lin Bao, you do remember to stay behind me and Mr. Su. Don't let Lin Bao lay a finger on you.",
"challengeStoryDesc2542":"Thank you for your care, Brother.",
"challengeStoryDesc2543":"[You enter the Banquet Hall and notice that there are several bandits who are not asleep yet.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2544":"Who...who are you?",
"challengeStoryDesc2545":"You...you...seem to be the insider we placed...Hmm...",
"challengeStoryDesc2546":"[Upon a close look, you recognize the bandit to be the guy who inspected you at the gate. You lied to him and the bandit took that to be true, which you find very amusing.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2547":"That's right. I am the insider Mr. Lin placed. Since we are brothers, now listen to me and surrender yourself, will you?",
"challengeStoryDesc2548":"[Before the bandit answers, Lin Bao has stood up.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2549":"Hey, you! What are you? Get lost... Don't you ruin my feast!",
"challengeStoryDesc2550":"Looks like Mr. Lin is so drunk that he doesn't even know where he is. Since so, Su will give you a hand.",
"challengeStoryDesc2551":"[Su Qi'er's words seem to restore some sobriety of Lin Bao.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2552":"You are...Hmph...Zhao An, you drugged my men. How dare you!",
"challengeStoryDesc2553":"Fancy the bandits call me a brother. How dare you, Lin Bao!",
"challengeStoryDesc2554":"Tsk. I don't think you can put a finger on me! Brothers, go...go get them!",
"challengeStoryDesc2555":"[A few half-awake bandits staggered towards you.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2556":"[With little effort are these bandits brought down by you.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2557":"Lin Bao, there's no way around. Surrender yourself!",
"challengeStoryDesc2558":"Hmph, look who's talking! Brothers, go get them.",
"challengeStoryDesc2559":"[Lin Bao shouts multiple times, only to find the bandits in dead sleep. There is a slight change in Lin Bao's countenance.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2560":"Lin Bao, don't fight it. You know clearly how guilty you are. Surrender now or you're asking for it.",
"challengeStoryDesc2561":"Whatever the amount of silver, tell me! Money is the most common stuff in Mount Zhongyi. As long as you let me go today, you have my promise...",
"challengeStoryDesc2562":"The money comes from the people! Mount Zhongyi is not built by rocks but robbery! What do you say? In the name of court, I announce you are now under arrest for mustering rebels and jeopardizing public security.",
"challengeStoryDesc2563":"[Lin Bao looks infuriated as you are not fettered by money.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2564":"The court...Pretty much a house of rogues.",
"challengeStoryDesc2565":"Shut up! You must be desperate now. But anyway, I won't have you speaking insolently like that!",
"challengeStoryDesc2566":"C'mon, show me what you're made of!",
"challengeStoryDesc2567":"[Lin Bao scoops the broadsword next to him and pounces upon you.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2568":"[Shan Ji and Su Qi'er keep you shielded by walking up.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2569":"Look out!",
"challengeStoryDesc2570":"[Being drunk, Lin Bao quickly get under hand.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2571":"[It is at this point that Lin Bao seems to be flurried.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2572":"As long as you let me go, you may have all the money in Mount Zhongyi...",
"challengeStoryDesc2573":"Lin Bao, cut the craps, will you? The money of Mount Zhongyi, I will confiscate it and return it to the public you have been plaguing. As for you, you figure out your well-deserved sanctions.",
"challengeStoryDesc2574":"Mr. Zhao, put Lin Bao in the dungeon. Given his untamable nature, do remember to footcuff him and place on heavy shackles.",
"challengeStoryDesc2575":"[Zhao An orders the guards to follow what you instructed.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2576":"[Having brought down Lin Bao, everyone gives a sigh of relief. And you look more than pleased.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2577":"Now that the biggest threat has been cleared, we will then put these sleepy dungeons in the dungeon.",
"challengeStoryDesc2578":"Brother, if there is any remnant bandit in the mansion, make sure he is purged.",
"challengeStoryDesc2579":"Rest assured, I will give the order as you say.",
"challengeStoryDesc2580":"Mr. Zhao, thank you for all that you've done. We will give credit to you for the capture of Lin Bao when we report to His Majesty in the Southern Tour.",
"challengeStoryDesc2581":"Thanks, Top Talent. What about Kang, my son...",
"challengeStoryDesc2582":"[Having anticipated that, you shake your head.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2583":"Mr. Zhao, they're different. We agreed that your son would be subject to the sentence of His Majesty. No one may interfere. So please drop that topic.",
"challengeStoryDesc2584":"[Zhao An hides the hatred within, reveals no facial expression and responds with Aye.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2585":"[Having cleared the remnant bandits in the mansion, you expand the purge scope targeting at the whole Yangzhou.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2586":"[Now that the siege has been freed, Yangzhou soon restores its former prosperity.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2587":"Green clouds against the nighty lanterns. Bustling guests on the hanging balcony. That is a true fact told by the ancient poets. Lin Bao deserves proper sentence for trampling on Yangzhou City.",
"challengeStoryDesc2588":"Now that Yangzhou has restored peace, the people here may enjoy a good and prosperous life.",
"challengeStoryDesc2589":"Good. Given that the business in Yangzhou has been dealt with, we may be expecting Prince Baylor to return to Yangzhou. Prince Baylor will have many decisions to make with regard to the Southern Tour.",
"challengeStoryDesc2590":"I will now give the order to escort Prince Baylor from Hangzhou.",
"challengeStoryDesc2591":"Hang on, Brother. You may as well write Prince Baylor a letter first. He must have been waiting in Hangzhou with anxiety. He may rest assured when he receives the message.",
"challengeStoryDesc2592":"You've always been very considerate. I'm on it.",
"challengeStoryDesc2593":"[After Shan Ji leaves, you and Shan Ji are ready to return to the Post.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2594":"[Suddenly, there comes a quick blast of air from behind.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2595":"Look out!",
"challengeStoryDesc2596":"[You and Su Qi'er stop the killer.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2597":"Who let you do that?",
"challengeStoryDesc2598":"You get Brother Lin, and I get your lives!",
"challengeStoryDesc2599":"Oh? Looks like you are with Lin Bao.",
"challengeStoryDesc2600":"[The assassin doesn't reply, from which you tell something isn't right. You quickly put your hands on his jaw.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2601":"[But it's too late. All you can see is that there is black blood in his mouth corner. You assume that he has committed a suicide with the poison in mouth.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2602":"Lin Bao didn't give up!",
"challengeStoryDesc2603":"The killer is not with Lin Bao.",
"challengeStoryDesc2604":"Why do you say that?",
"challengeStoryDesc2605":"He will not give up his life easily if he's with Lin Bao. It's not typical of a bandit to think things through and pull that stunt. It's more of an expendable.",
"challengeStoryDesc2606":"[Su Qi'er is more than infuriated after reading what you meant.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2607":"It's Zhao An, the old bastard. Hmph, kicking down the ladder, what a move!",
"challengeStoryDesc2608":"Don't be mad, Mr. Su. It's not time to throw the table. Besides, you will be there to keep those killers from me.",
"challengeStoryDesc2609":"[Your words calm down Su Qi'er.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2610":"[Days later, you receive a message from Shan Ji, saying that Prince Baylor has left Hangzhou for Yangzhou.]",
"challengeStoryDesc2611":"We should be receiving Prince Baylor when he arrives.",
"challengeStoryDesc2612":"[Along with Su Qi'er, you go to receive Prince Baylor.]",

"newatkracecrossDespath_rule":"<font color=0xfeffc7><font color=0x00ff00>[Ultimate Arena]</font>The number of partaking Retainers is limited to 30 in Ultimate Arena. The designated Formation applies to both Challenge and Defense. Players are able to manually adjust their Formations from the end of Qualification event to the beginning of Ultimate Arena. The default Formation is automatically set as Top 30 Retainers in Aptitude (including Retainers who have been Exiled and Refused Battle). Formation cannot be changed since the start of Ultimate Arena. Players with less than 30 Retainers will be automatically eliminated. Players with less than 30 Retainers during Qualification event but with 30 or more Retainers before the beginning of Ultimate Arena are required to manually adjust and save their Formations to participate\n\n<font color=0x00ff00>[Score Protection]</font>There is a protective mechanism on Score in Ultimate Arena. When a player attacks an opponent with less than -2,000 Score or {1} Score lower than him/her, this player will not obtain Score unless his/her opponent is a Top {2} player on the Ranking. This mechanism will be activated when the matchup is confirmed. The lowest Score in Ultimate Arena is -2,000\n\n<font color=0x00ff00>[Random Battle]</font>Retainers are dispatched according to the descending order of Aptitude in Random Battle. The other rules adopt the same ones as in Arena. Retainers dispatched in Random Battle (including Retainers dispatched by using War Tokens) do not consume Active Dispatch times\n\n<font color=0x00ff00>[Active Dispatch]</font>When a player uses Challenge Letters or Hunt Tokens to dispatch all 30 Retainers, the Active Dispatch status of all Retainers will be restored. This player is able to consume more Items to actively dispatch these Retainers to fight for another round. There is an upper limit of extra times each day, which is decided by the total number of a player’s Retainers. (e.g. A player with 32 Retainers enjoys 2 extra times. A player with 62 Retainers is able to actively dispatch his/her Retainers for 2 rounds plus 2 extra times). The times are reset at 0:00 each day\n\n<font color=0x00ff00>[Renown]</font>Renown is divided into certain Renown Classes. Higher Renown Classes provides players with higher Attack Bonus. The player at a higher Renown Class will take the initiative and receives an additional Attack Bonus in battles. When both sides are at the same Renown Class, the player who takes the higher Seat will take the initiative and receives an additional Attack Bonus in battles. When the Renown of both sides is 0, there will be no Bonus. The offensive side will take the initiative in odd-numbered rounds. Click on other players’ Avatars to enter a Character battle, in which the result will be decided by Improvement Attributes. Battle times are reset daily and can be reset by using Ingots\n\n<font color=0x00ff00>[Multiple Retainer Bonus]</font>Dispatched Retainers will obtain a Bonus based on the Total Aptitude of non-partaking Retainers.

"newatkracecross_rule":"<font color=0xfeffc7><font color=0x00ff00>[Ultimate Arena]</font>The number of partaking Retainers is limited to 30 in Ultimate Arena. The designated Formation applies to both Challenge and Defense. Players are able to manually adjust their Formations from the end of Qualification event to the beginning of Ultimate Arena. The default Formation is automatically set as Top 30 Retainers in Aptitude (including Retainers who have been Exiled and Refused Battle). Formation cannot be changed since the start of Ultimate Arena. Players with less than 30 Retainers will be automatically eliminated. Players with less than 30 Retainers during Qualification event but with 30 or more Retainers before the beginning of Ultimate Arena are required to manually adjust and save their Formations to participate\n\n<font color=0x00ff00>[Score Protection]</font>There is a protective mechanism on Score in Ultimate Arena. When a player attacks an opponent with less than -2,000 Score or {1} Score lower than him/her, this player will not obtain Score unless his/her opponent is a Top {2} player on the Ranking. This mechanism will be activated when the matchup is confirmed. The lowest Score in Ultimate Arena is -2,000\n\n<font color=0x00ff00>[Random Battle]</font>Retainers are dispatched according to the descending order of Aptitude in Random Battle. The other rules adopt the same ones as in Arena. Retainers dispatched in Random Battle (including Retainers dispatched by using War Tokens) do not consume Active Dispatch times\n\n<font color=0x00ff00>[Active Dispatch]</font>When a player uses Challenge Letters or Hunt Tokens to dispatch all 30 Retainers, the Active Dispatch status of all Retainers will be restored. This player is able to consume more Items to actively dispatch these Retainers to fight for another round. There is an upper limit of extra times each day, which is decided by the total number of a player’s Retainers. (e.g. A player with 32 Retainers enjoys 2 extra times. A player with 62 Retainers is able to actively dispatch his/her Retainers for 2 rounds plus 2 extra times). The times are reset at 0:00 each day\n\n<font color=0x00ff00>[Renown]</font>Renown is divided into certain Renown Classes. Higher Renown Classes provides players with higher Attack Bonus. The player at a higher Renown Class will take the initiative and receives an additional Attack Bonus in battles. When both sides are at the same Renown Class, the player who takes the higher Seat will take the initiative and receives an additional Attack Bonus in battles. When the Renown of both sides is 0, there will be no Bonus. The offensive side will take the initiative in odd-numbered rounds. Click on other players’ Avatars to enter a Character battle, in which the result will be decided by Improvement Attributes. Battle times are reset daily and can be reset by using Ingots\n\n<font color=0x00ff00>[Multiple Retainer Bonus]</font>Dispatched Retainers will obtain a Bonus based on the Total Aptitude of non-partaking Retainers. The side with higher Renown will take the initiative in battles\n\n<font color=0x00ff00>[Heated Fighting Spirit]</font>When 2 Characters/Retainers are fighting each other, their Attack will be doubled every 5 turns until one of them is defeated. After that, their Attack will be reset to the default value</font>",

In essence, the plan required Liu Bei to gain control over Jing and Yi provinces, respectively, so as to secure a viable base for staging attacks against Liu Bei's rival, Cao Cao. The plan also required Liu Bei to form a strategic alliance with another warlord, Sun Quan, who was based in eastern China.",
"acLiangBiographyProcessPopupViewDesc_2-1":"In 208 AD, Zhuge Liang and Zhou Yu coincided with each other to fight against Cao Cao with fire. Everything was ready. They only owe the east wind. Zhuge Liang could borrow the east wind. In the center of the altar, he danced with a sword, and everyone looked forward to it. Sure enough, Zhuge Liang really bring east wind and defeated Cao Cao.",
"acLiangBiographyProcessPopupViewDesc_3-1":"Relations between Liu Bei and Sun Quan deteriorated after Zhou Yu's death, but not to the point of war. Following Zhuge Liang's Longzhong Plan, Liu Bei led his forces westward into Yi Province and seized control of the territories from the governor, Liu Zhang. By then, Liu Bei ruled over a vast stretch of land from Yi Province to southern Jing Province; these territories served as the foundation of the state of Shu Han later. Liu Bei declared himself King of Hanzhong after defeating Cao Cao in the Hanzhong Campaign and capturing Hanzhong Commandery.",
"acLiangBiographyProcessPopupViewDesc_4-1":"In 221 AD, Zhuge Liang was appointed Counsellor-in-chief. Liu Bei soon fell sick and entrusted his under-age son Liu Shan to the loyal Counsellor. Zhuge Liang was also appointed regional governor of the province of Yizhou and was given the title of Marquis of Wuxiang. Liu Shan proved to be a very weak persons, so that Zhuge Liang was in fact the regent of the empire of Shu-Han.",

So Liu decided to invite him to be his prime minister to help strengthen the State of Shu. In the year 207AD, Liu Bei traveled to Longzhong to ask Zhuge Liang to assist him. But Zhuge was not at home. Thus they had to return disappointedly. Later, they came again. But again they failed to see Zhuge, because he had been wandering about for days and hadn't yet come back. This time, Liu Bei left a note expressing his meaning. Some days passed, Liu wanted to make a third visit. \nThis time, Liu Bei saw him in his house in Longzhong. Liu Bei said: [The Han dynasty is in decline. Villainous officials usurp power while the Emperor was forced into exile. I may be unworthy in both strength and virtue, but I still want to uphold justice and righteousness in the Empire. However, I am not intelligent and shrewd enough, which is why I have repeatedly suffered setbacks and ended up in my current situation. Nevertheless, I have neither deviated from my initial intentions nor given up on my ambitions. Sir, what do you think I can do?] \nZhuge Liang replied:[Since Dong Zhuo usurped power, many warlords throughout the Empire have risen up, seized and controlled territories.\nCao Cao was inferior to Yuan Shao in terms of fame and military power, yet he managed to defeat Yuan Shao and transform from a weak to a powerful warlord. This was not due to only favourable circumstances, but also human intelligence and wisdom. Now, as Cao Cao leads hundreds of thousands of troops and uses the Emperor's name to command other warlords, you definitely can't compete with him directly.\nSun Quan rules over Jiangdong and his family has controlled the region for three generations. He has geographical advantage, the hearts of the people, and the support of many wise and talented advisers. You should attempt to make contact and form an alliance with him instead of trying to conquer his territories.\nAs for Jing Province, it has natural geographical barriers such as the Han and Mian rivers in the north, as well as direct access to an abundance of resources from the sea in the south. It is connected to Wu and Kuaiji commanderies in the east, and Ba and Shu commanderies in the west. It is a strategic location in the eyes of military strategists. Its ruler doesn't have the capability to defend it. It is a special gift from Heaven to you, General. Do you, General, have the intention of seizing it?\nYi Province is a geographically strategic location. It has thousands of li of fertile land and has been called a [Country of Heaven]. Emperor Gaozu used it as his base when he started conquering the Empire. Liu Zhang is incompetent and weak. He also faces the threat of Zhang Lu in the north. Even though his domain is wealthy and prosperous, he doesn't know how to treasure it. All the talents there hope to serve under a wise ruler.\nGeneral, you are not only a member of the imperial clan, but also a man famous throughout the Empire for his integrity and righteousness. You have attracted heroes to aid you, and you seek wise and capable talents like a thirsty man looking for water. If you control Jing and Yi provinces and make use of their strategic geography to defend them well. At the same time, you should foster good relations with the Rong peoples in the west and implement policies to placate and pacify the Yi and Yue peoples in the south. Externally, you should build a strong alliance with Sun Quan; internally, you should reform government and promote civil culture.\nWhen the opportunity arises, you can order one of your senior officers to lead troops from Jing Province to attack Wancheng and Luoyang, while you, General, can personally lead troops out of Yi Province via the Qin Mountains. When you do this, won't the people welcome you and your troops with food and drink? If this really happens, you will be able to fulfil your ambition and the Han dynasty will be revived.]</font>",
"acLiangBiographyScrollPopupViewDesc2-1":"<font size=20>In 208AD, Zhou Yu and Liu Bei led their forces to fight Cao Cao. Cao Cao led a force of 300000 to attack Wu State.\nZhou Yu led the Wu forces (30 000) with Liu Bei's forces (20 000).\nCao Cao had previously linked his ships together because his men were mainly composed of Northerners who were not accustomed to fighting on water; they were also sick after an epidemic.\nIn the meantime, Huang Gai faked himself a turncoat, seeking giving top secret of Wu’s army to Cao Cao.\nAt the night of the battle, Huang Gai fabricated his escape from the South side of the Yangtze River where Wu’s camp is to the North side where Wei's base is.\nNear the Northern bank, Huang Gai set his tail boat on fire. At the same time, Zhuge Liang brought east wind to help the fire spread. The Cao Cao's armada, connected together, was caught fired in the bay and nearly totally destroyed. \nZhou Yu, at this time, sent his whole army against Cao Cao's army which lost all its morale.\nCao Cao decided it would be best to retreat.\nThe result of the Battle of Red Cliff greatly hindered Cao Cao's expansion across Yangtze River into the Southern China.</font>",
"acLiangBiographyScrollPopupViewDesc3-1":"<font size=20>After Zhou Yu's death, relations between Liu Bei and Sun Quan deteriorated, but not to the point of outright war. Following Zhuge Liang's advice, Liu Bei invaded and conquered Xichuan, where the incompetent noble Liu Zhang ruled. He also took Hanzhong, which had been in Cao Cao's control. Liu Bei proclaimed himself King of Hanzhong, while Cao Cao had himself promoted from Prime Minister to King of Wei; Sun Quan was known as the Duke of Wu. At this time, Liu Bei ruled a vast area of land from Jingzhou to Sichuan in the west. This would later serve as a strong foundation for the founding of the Kingdom of Shu-Han. Meanwhile, Sun Quan and Cao Cao were also at war, with defeats and victories for both sides at the battles of Ruxu and Hefei.</font>",
"acLiangBiographyScrollPopupViewDesc4-1":"<font size=20>The situation among the three major powers almost reached a stalemate after this, until Cao Cao died due to a brain tumor. The following year, Cao Cao's son Cao Pi forced Emperor Xian to abdicate, ending the Han Dynasty which had lasted for centuries. Cao Pi proclaimed himself emperor and renamed his dynasty Cao Wei. In response to this, Liu Bei declared himself Emperor of Shu-Han, to signify that he still carried on the bloodline of the Han royal family, but was based in Shu. \nAfter Liu Bei's death, Cao Pi induced several forces, including Sun Quan, a turncoat Shu general Meng Da, the Nanman and Qiang tribes, to attack Shu, in coordination with a Wei army. However, Zhuge Liang managed to make the five armies retreat without any bloodshed. He also sent Deng Zhi to make peace with Sun Quan and restore the alliance between Shu and Wu. Zhuge Liang then personally led a southern campaign against the Nanman, defeated them seven times, and won the allegiance of the Nanman king, Meng Huo.\nAfter pacifying the south, Zhuge Liang led the Shu army on five military expeditions to attack Wei as part of his mission to restore the Han dynasty. However, his days were numbered because he had been suffering from chronic illness and his condition worsened under stress. He would die of illness at the Battle of Wuzhang Plains while leading a stalemate battle against the Wei general Sima Yi.</font>",
"acLiangBiographyScrollPopupViewDesc5-1":"<font size=20>At this time, Cao Pi also died of illness and was succeeded by Cao Rui. Ma Chao died of illness as well, age 48. In Jiangdong, Sun Quan declared himself Emperor of East Wu. Zhuge Liang then turned his eyes northwards, and planned to attack Wei to restore the Han Dynasty as he had promised Liu Bei at the latter's deathbed. However, his days were numbered and Shu was far too weak to overcome the material superiority of Wei. His last significant victory against Wei was probably the defection of Jiang Wei, a young general whose brilliance paralleled his own. \n[Zhuge Liang had all along had a chronic illness, which was compounded when he refused to rest even into the early hours of the morning, so that he would be able to complete his analysis of the battlegrounds or to formulate his next plan. He finally died of sickness at the Battle of Wuzhang Plains, while leading a stalemated battle against the Wei commander, Sima Yi, with his far superior force. As a final ploy, he set up a statue of himself to scare off Sima Yi in order to buy time for the Shu army to retreat.\n[The long years of battle between Wei and Shu saw many changes in the ruling Cao family in Wei. The Cao family gradually grew weak after the death of Cao Rui and Sima Yi slowly plotted to usurp the throne. Sima Yi removed Cao Shuang, a powerful noble of Wei from power with a cunning strategy and since then the power of Wei had been in the hands of Sima Yi. After Sima Yi's death, his sons Sima Shi and Sima Zhao continued wielding the power of Wei in their hands. Sima Zhao had Cao Fang removed from the throne and replaced Cao Fang with Cao Mao. Later, Cao Mao tried to assassinate Sima Zhao, who had the intention of usurping the throne, but was killed by Sima Zhao's subordinate. Sima Zhao pretended to grieve and mourn Cao Mao's death and even later had his subordinate, whom he ordered to kill Cao Mao, executed for committing regicide.</font>",

This leads to Cao Cao's defeat as his battleships are unable to separate from each other during the fire attack, and when one ship is set aflame, the other ships linked to it catch fire as well.</font>",

He initially served as an Assistant Officer and as the county magistrate of Leiyang, but was later dismissed from office due to poor performance.

Liu Bei's strategist Zhuge Liang also recommended Pang Tong, so Liu Bei recruited Pang to be an Assistant Officer in the Headquarters Office .

"acLiangBiographyScrollPopupViewDesc3-3":"<font size=20>Around the early 210s, Pang Tong convinced Liu Bei to seize Yi Province and use its resources to compete with his rival Cao Cao for supremacy. Liu Bei heeded Pang Tong's suggestion. In 211, Liu Bei led an army from Jing Province into Yi Province on the pretext of helping Yi Province's governor, Liu Zhang, counter an invasion from the warlord Zhang Lu in Hanzhong Commandery. Zhuge Liang remained behind to guard Jing Province while Pang Tong followed Liu Bei to Yi Province.Liu Zhang received Liu Bei. Pang Tong urged Liu Bei to use the opportunity to capture Liu Zhang and force him to hand over Yi Province, but Liu Bei refused because he was new to Yi Province and had not established a strong foundation there yet. Liu Zhang later returned to Yi Province's capital, Chengdu.</font>",
"acLiangBiographyScrollPopupViewDesc4-3":"<font size=20>Pang Tong outlined three plans for Liu Bei to choose from:\n\nThe upper plan: Select the best soldiers to form an elite force and advance quickly towards Chengdu, and force Liu Zhang to surrender and hand over Yi Province. Pang Tong also believed that Liu Zhang was not competent in military affairs and was unprepared, so the chances of success were high.\nThe middle plan: Spread false news that Liu Bei was returning to Jing Province, then lure Liu Zhang's officers Yang Huai and Gao Pei away from the fortified mountain passes they were defending, kill them and take control of their positions and troops, and finally advance towards Chengdu.\nThe lower plan: Retreat to Baidicheng and wait for another opportunity to attack.\nLiu Bei chose the middle plan and executed it – he killed Yang Huai and Gao Pei, led his forces towards Chengdu and conquered several of Liu Zhang's territories along the way.\n\nWhen Liu Bei expressed joy during a banquet in Fu County to celebrate his success, Pang Tong chided him, saying that [celebrating the invasion of others' territory isn't what a man of ren (benevolence) should do]. The drunk Liu Bei retorted angrily, [King Wu of Zhou also rejoiced after his victory over King Zhou of Shang. Is he not an example of a man of ren? You're wrong, so get out now!] After Pang Tong left, Liu Bei regretted what he said so he invited Pang back. Pang Tong returned to his seat and did not say anything, so Liu Bei asked, [When that quarrel happened just now, whose fault do you think it was?] Pang Tong replied, [It was both yours and mine.] Liu Bei laughed and the banquet continued.</font>",

He died after being hit by a stray arrow in the midst of battle. He was 36 years old (by East Asian age reckoning) at the time of his death. Liu Bei was deeply saddened by Pang Tong's death and he would weep whenever Pang Tong was mentioned. Pang Tong was posthumously made a Secondary Marquis after Liu Bei became emperor and established the state of Shu Han in 221.

"acLiangBiographyScrollPopupViewDesc1-5":"<font size=20>Guo Jia once travelled to Hebei to meet Yuan Shao, an influential warlord who controlled most of northern China at the time. He later told Yuan Shao's advisers Xin Ping and Guo Tu, [An intelligent adviser should be prudent when he chooses which lord he wishes to serve so that his lord will heed every piece of advice he gives. The adviser can then establish his reputation. Lord Yuan (Yuan Shao) wishes to mimic the Duke of Zhou by recruiting men of talent to serve under him but he does not know how to tap into their abilities. He focuses too much on unnecessary details and neglects the main points; he likes to listen to many ideas but is indecisive. It is difficult for him to save the Empire from its troubles and achieve hegemony over the various warlords!] Guo Jia then left Yuan Shao.\n\nSix years later, Cao Cao had a brilliant adviser, Xi Zhicai, whom he appreciated greatly, but Xi died early. Cao Cao told another adviser Xun Yu, [Ever since Xi Zhicai died, I've been lacking someone whom I can form strategies with. I heard there are many talents in the Ru and Ying regions. Who can replace Xi Zhicai?] Xun Yu recommended Guo Jia to Cao Cao. Cao Cao and Guo Jia had a discussion on the affairs of their time, after which the former remarked: [This must be the man who will help me achieve greatness.] Guo Jia also happily said, [He's truly the lord I wish to serve.] Guo Jia was then appointed as a Libationer in the army of Cao Cao, who then held the position of Minister over the Masses in the imperial court.</font>",
"acLiangBiographyScrollPopupViewDesc2-5":"<font size=20>In 198, Cao Cao launched a campaign against his rival Lu Bu in Xu Province. Lu Bu lost three battles and retreated to Xiapi. Cao Cao's forces besieged the city for months but they still could not conquer it because Lu Bu and his men resisted firmly. By then, Cao Cao's troops were tired and weary of battle, so Cao intended to withdraw his forces. However, Guo Jia and Xun You told Cao Cao, [Lu Bu is courageous but foolhardy. His army's morale is low because he has already lost three battles. The troops look up to their commander. If their commander shows any sign of weakness, the men will lose their fighting spirit. Lu Bu may have Chen Gong as an intelligent adviser but the latter's strategies always come late. Now, we should take advantage of this situation, when the morale of Lu Bu's forces is low and when Chen Gong has yet to think of a solution, to press on a fierce attack and we'll achieve victory.] Cao Cao heeded their advice and directed the waters of the rivers to flood Xiapi, resulting in his triumph over Lu Bu.</font>",
"acLiangBiographyScrollPopupViewDesc3-5":"<font size=20>Cao Cao wanted to attack Liu Bei (who had rebelled and seized control of Xu Province) first before dealing with Yuan Shao. However, some of Cao Cao's advisers expressed their worries that Yuan Shao would take advantage of their absence to attack them, rendering them trapped between Yuan and Liu Bei. Cao Cao faced a dilemma so he asked Guo Jia for his opinion. Guo Jia suggested, [Yuan Shao is suspicious and he hesitates before he makes any decision, so he won't make his move fast. Liu Bei had just taken control of Xu Province so his situation isn't stable yet. He can be easily defeated if we attack him fast and hard. This is a critical opportunity, we mustn't lose it.] Cao Cao agreed and immediately led an army east to attack Liu Bei and defeated the latter. After his defeat, Liu Bei fled to Hebei to join Yuan Shao. Throughout that period of time, Yuan Shao did not make any move.\n\nBetween 194 and 199, the warlord Sun Ce embarked on a series of conquests in Jiangdong and seized control of most of the territories in the region. Around 200, Cao Cao finally engaged Yuan Shao at the Battle of Guandu. When Sun Ce heard that Cao Cao was locked in a stalemate with Yuan Shao at Guandu, he planned to lead an army across the Yangtze River and launch a surprise attack on the imperial capital Xu, which was Cao Cao's base. When Cao Cao's men received news of the impending assault, they were all shocked and frightened, but Guo Jia said, [Sun Ce had newly conquered the lands in Jiangdong and he killed many heroes whose followers were willing to die for them. Besides, Sun Ce is overly confident and is unprepared, so even though he has thousands of troops, the situation is not much different from him setting out to conquer the Central Plains all by himself. If he encounters assassins, he'll have to deal with them alone. From what I observe, he'll eventually die at the hands of a common man.] Guo Jia's prediction came true as Sun Ce was assassinated before he could even carry out his plan.\n\nGuo Jia's accurate prediction of Sun Ce's assassination was a display of Guo's foresight.\n\nCao Cao scored a decisive victory over Yuan Shao at the Battle of Guandu in 200. Yuan Shao died two years after his defeat and his sons Yuan Tan and Yuan Shang started fighting each other for control over their father's vast domain. Cao Cao defeated Yuan Tan and Yuan Shang at the Battle of Liyang in 202–203 and won several consecutive battles. At the time, many of Cao Cao's generals urged Cao to take advantage of his successes to continue attacking the Yuans, but Guo Jia said, [Yuan Shao loved both sons so he couldn't decide between them who would succeed him. With advisers like Guo Tu and Pang Ji to assist the Yuans, internal conflict will definitely break out between them. If we press on our attacks, the Yuans will unite to resist us. If we withdraw our forces, the Yuans will start fighting among themselves. Why don't we turn south and attack Liu Biao in Jing Province first? We should wait until the Yuan brothers start fighting each other and then attack them. We'll achieve victory in this way.] Cao Cao agreed and prepared for a campaign against Liu Biao.\n\nInternal conflict did break out between Yuan Tan and Yuan Shang later, which resulted in Yuan Tan being defeated by his younger brother. Yuan Tan retreated and sent Xin Pi to meet Cao Cao, agreeing to surrender to Cao and requesting for assistance in dealing with Yuan Shang. Cao Cao led his forces north and defeated Yuan Shang in 204. In 205, Cao Cao attacked Yuan Tan on some pretence and defeated him. By then, Cao Cao had pacified most of Ji Province in northern China. In recognition of his contributions, the Han imperial court enfeoffed Guo Jia as the Marquis of Weiyang Village.</font>",
"acLiangBiographyScrollPopupViewDesc4-5":"<font size=20>Guo Jia fell ill after departing from Liucheng following Cao Cao's victory at the Battle of White Wolf Mountain in 207. He was 38 years old (by East Asian age reckoning) at that time and he died not long later. Cao Cao was very grieved by Guo Jia's death. He told other ministers, [All of you are around the same age as me; only Guo Jia was the youngest. I planned to entrust him with responsibilities before my death, but it's destined that he would die at such a young age.]\n\nGuo Jia was known for his deep foresight, which allowed him to accurately predict the outcomes of events. Cao Cao once remarked, [Only Guo Jia knows what's on my mind.]</font>",
"acLiangBiographyScrollPopupViewDesc5-5":"<font size=20>Cao Cao then wrote a memorial [Army Libationer Guo Jia had served in the military for 11 years. There would be a discussion whenever we faced difficult situations, and when I could not decide on what to do, he was the one who helped me arrive at my decisions. He has made great contributions in the pacification of the Empire. It is unfortunate that he died early and did not manage to complete his task. We should not forget his contributions. I suggest that his family be granted an additional 800 taxable households under their control, making it a total of 1,000 households.] The history book recorded a longer memorial written by Cao Cao, requesting for Guo Jia to be honoured. Guo Jia was granted the posthumous title [Marquis Zhen], which literally means [Chaste Marquis]</font>",

"acLiangBiographyScrollPopupViewDesc1-7":"<font size=20>In 215, Sima Yi accompanied Cao Cao on his campaign against the warlord Zhang Lu, whom Cao Cao defeated in Hanzhong Commandery at the Battle of Yangping, and afterwards Sima Yi urged him to capitalize on the momentum to press on and attack his rival, Liu Bei, who was in the neighboring Yi Province. Sima Yi pointed out that since Liu Bei had only recently seized control of Yi Province from Liu Zhang, he had yet to establish a strong foothold in the province. However, Cao Cao rejected Sima Yi's idea and said that he was already content with having Longyou. He then turned his attention towards his other key rival, Sun Quan.\nSun Quan sent an emissary to meet Cao Cao, requesting to make peace and expressing his willingness to pledge allegiance to Cao Cao. He also urged Cao Cao to seize the throne from Emperor Xian and declare himself emperor. In response to Sun Quan's suggestion, Cao Cao remarked: [This rascal wants me to put myself on top of a fire!] However, Sima Yi told him: [The Han dynasty is in decline. Your Lordship controls nine-tenths of the Han Empire. You are in a position to take the throne. Sun Quan's submission is the will of Heaven. Previously, during Yu's time and throughout the Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties, the rulers who did not hesitate when they should take the throne were the ones who truly understood Heaven's will.] Cao Cao ultimately never usurped the throne from Emperor Xian and remained nominally a subject of the Han Empire until his death.\nIn 216, after Emperor Xian promoted Cao Cao from a duke to a vassal king under the title [King of Wei], Sima Yi became an adviser to Cao Cao's son and heir apparent, Cao Pi. Cao Pi highly regarded and respected Sima Yi for his brilliance. Along with Chen Qun, Wu Zhi, and Zhu Shuo, Sima Yi was one of Cao Pi's close aides and one of his [Four Friends]. Before Cao Pi became his father's heir apparent in 216, he engaged in a power struggle against his younger brother Cao Zhi over the succession. During this time, Sima Yi was believed to be among those who secretly backed Cao Pi and helped him win the position of heir apparent. He also allegedly had a hand in Cao Zhi's demotion and removal from politics after Cao Pi became the emperor.\nWhen Sima Yi was appointed as an Army Major, he suggested to Cao Cao to stockpile food supplies and maintain their defenses at the same time because there were more than 200,000 people who were unable to sustain themselves through farming. Cao Cao accepted his idea and implemented a policy for the people to farm and stockpile grain.</font>",
"acLiangBiographyScrollPopupViewDesc2-7":"<font size=20>In March or April 234, Zhuge Liang reportedly led around 100,000 Shu troops (although it was likely closer to 60,000) out of the Xie Valley  and camped at the southern bank of the Wei River near Mei County.\nSima Yi's subordinates wanted to station their camp north of the Wei River, but Sima Yi said: [Many civilians have gathered at the south of the Wei River. That will definitely become a hotly contested location.] Sima Yi then led his troops across the Wei River and took up his position with his rear facing the river, and began constructing fortifications. He additionally said: [If Zhuge Liang is brave enough, he'll move out from Wugong County and head eastward in the direction of the mountains. If he moves west to the Wuzhang Plains, we'll have no worries.] Around that time, the Wei emperor, Cao Rui, became worried, and so decided to send the general Qin Lang to lead 20,000 infantry and cavalry as reinforcements to join Sima Yi.\nWhile Sima Yi and his troops were stationed at the south of the Wei River, Guo Huai urged him and the various officers to move a detachment to the plains on the north bank of the river as he foresaw that Zhuge Liang would attempt to seize the plains.\nDuring that time, Zhuge Liang moved his army west to the Wuzhang Plains and prepared to cross to the northern bank of the Wei River. Sima Yi sent Zhou Dang to station at Yangsui and lure Zhuge Liang to attack him. However, Zhuge Liang did not mobilize his troops for several days, and Sima Yi reportedly exclaimed: [Zhuge Liang wants to take control of the Wuzhang Plains and won't advance towards Yangsui. His intention is obvious.] He then sent Hu Zun and Guo Huai to defend Yangsui. Several days later, Guo Huai received news that Zhuge Liang was planning to launch an attack in the west, and his subordinates therefore wanted to strengthen their defenses in the west. Guo Huai was the only one who recognized that it was a ruse, and that Zhuge Liang was actually planning to attack Yangsui. He was proven right later as the Shu forces attacked Yangsui at night. However, as Guo Huai had set up defenses earlier, the Shu forces failed to capture Yangsui. Zhuge Liang could not advance further, so he retreated back to the Wuzhang Plains.\nOne night, Sima Yi saw a star falling towards the Shu camp and predicted that Zhuge Liang would be defeated. He ordered a surprise attack on the Shu camp from behind: 500 Shu soldiers were killed, 600 surrendered, and more than 1,000 livestock of the Shu army were captured by Wei forces. This account, which stems from the Book of Jin, is not included in the Zizhi Tongjian. Instead, the accounts from the Records of the Three Kingdoms were included in the Zizhi Tongjian.\nAround that time, the Wei government observed that since the Shu army was far away from its base at Hanzhong Commandery, it would not be in its interest to fight a prolonged war in enemy territory, so it would be better for the Wei army to adopt a defensive posture against the Shu invaders. The Wei emperor, Cao Rui, thus ordered Sima Yi to hold his position and refrain from engaging the Shu forces in battle. Zhuge Liang attempted to lure Sima Yi to attack him; on one occasion, Zhuge Liang supposedly sent Sima Yi women's ornaments to taunt him. Sima Yi, apparently feeling enraged, sought permission from Cao Rui to attack the enemy, but was denied. The emperor even sent Xin Pi, bearing the imperial scepter (a symbol of the emperor's authority), to the battlefield to make sure that Sima Yi followed orders and remained in camp. Zhuge Liang knew that Sima Yi was pretending to be angry because he wanted to show the Wei soldiers that he would not put up with the enemy's taunting, and to ensure that the Wei soldiers were ready for battle.\nWhen Sima Fu wrote to Sima Yi to ask him about the situation at the Wuzhang Plains, Sima Yi replied by saying: [Zhuge Liang has big ambitions but he fails to recognize opportunities. He is full of wits but not decisive. He likes leading troops into battle even though he does not have much authority over them. Even though he has 100,000 troops under his command, he has already fallen into my trap and I'll certainly defeat him.] When Zhuge Liang's envoy visited Sima Yi's camp, the latter allegedly inquired about his sleeping and eating habits, along with how busy he was. When told how Zhuge Liang consumed little and didn't sleep much, Sima Yi said to his men: [Zhuge Kongming takes little food and does much work; how can he last long?]\nMeanwhile, according to at least one source, Sima Yi continued to provoke Zhuge Liang. Sima Yi reportedly made some 2,000 people cheer by the southeast corner of the military compound. When Zhuge Liang sent a man to inquire on the situation, he stated: [Eastern Wu's envoy came and said he would surrender.] Zhuge Liang responded: [Eastern Wu will not surrender. Sima Yi is an old man who will soon be 60 years old, does he really need to use such a trick?]\nAfter a standoff lasting more than 100 days, Sima Yi heard from civilians that Zhuge Liang had died from illness and the Shu army had burnt down their camp and retreated. He then led his troops to pursue the enemy and caught up with them, but withdrew when the Shu forces got into battle formation. Some days later, Sima Yi surveyed the remains of the Shu camp and thereafter reportedly exclaimed: [He was a genius.] He also concluded that Zhuge Liang was indeed dead when he saw that the Shu army had hastily retreated. Xin Pi felt that they could not be certain about Zhuge Liang's death yet, but Sima Yi said: [The most important things in an army are its documents, troops, horses, and supplies. (Zhuge Liang) has abandoned all of them. How can a person lose his five most important organs and still be alive? We should quickly pursue (the enemy).] The ground in the Guanzhong region was full of devil's weed so Sima Yi sent 2,000 men wearing wooden clogs with flat soles to clear the path before his main army advanced and continued pursuing the enemy, although he retreated when he eventually encountered the Shu forces. When Sima Yi heard that there was a saying: [A dead Zhuge (Liang) scares away a living Zhongda]， he laughed and said: [I can predict the thoughts of the living but I can't predict the dead.]</font>",
"acLiangBiographyScrollPopupViewDesc3-7":"<font size=20>In January 238, Cao Rui summoned Sima Yi back to the imperial capital Luoyang to lead a campaign against Liaodong. When asked by the emperor as to how Gongsun Yuan will respond, Sima Yi stated that there were three choices available: to flee, to resist, and to defend his capital city, with the last being the worst choice, and the one he was most likely going to employ against Sima Yi after putting up some initial resistance. When further asked by the emperor on how long it will take, Sima Yi said that he needed only one year in total to lead the troops to Liaodong, to suppress the revolt, and to then return and repose. At the time, the Wei government had forced many men into military service or recruited them for manual labour to work on Cao Rui's palace construction/renovation projects. Sima Yi felt that doing so would increase the burden on the common people and make them resent the Wei government, so he advised Cao Rui to halt the projects and focus on dealing with the more pressing issues.\nThereafter, Sima Yi set out with an army of 40,000 men from Luoyang to attack Liaodong, with Niu Jin and Hu Zun  serving as his subordinates. Cao Rui personally saw him off at Luoyang's Ximing Gate , where he ordered Sima Yi's brother Sima Fu and son Sima Shi, as well as other officials to attend the ceremony. \nAfter his army occupied Xiangping, Sima Yi erected a pair of guideposts to separate recent and long-time serving government officials and military personnel of Gongsun Yuan's disestablished regime, and thereafter ordered a systematic purge of some 2,000 officials. He also had some 7,000 men aged 15 and above from within the city executed and raised a victory mound with their corpses, while pardoning all the remaining survivors. In total, Sima Yi's conquest gained Wei an additional 40,000 households and over 300,000 citizens, although Sima Yi did not encourage these frontier settlers to continue their livelihoods in the Chinese northeast and instead ordered that those families who wished to return to central China be allowed to do so. Sima Yi also posthumously rehabilitated and erected mounds over the graves of Lun Zhi and Jia Fan, two officials who had attempted to stop Gongsun Yuan from rebelling but were executed by him, and also freed Gongsun Gong, the previous Administrator of Liaodong, who had been imprisoned by his nephew Gongsun Yuan, with all of this being carried out under an order which stated: [During the ancients' attacks on states, they executed their fiercest enemies, and that was all. Those who were deceived and misled by Wenyi, all are forgiven. People of the Central States who desire to return to their old hometowns are free to do so.]\nAt the time, as it was winter, many soldiers were suffering from the cold and wanted extra clothing to keep themselves warm. When someone pointed out that they had a surplus of short coat and suggested giving them out to the soldiers, Sima Yi said: [The padded coats are the property of the government. No one is allowed to give them to others without permission.] Sima Yi did, however, memorialise that all soldiers aged 60 and above, numbering over 1,000 men, to retire from their service, and for the dead and wounded to be sent home. As Sima Yi led the troops back to Luoyang from Liaodong, Cao Rui sent an emissary to meet them in Ji County and host a party to celebrate the victory. He also added Kunyang County to Sima Yi's marquisate, so Sima Yi had a total of two counties as his marquisate.",
"acLiangBiographyScrollPopupViewDesc4-7":"<font size=20>In early 239, when Cao Fang started ruling as the new Wei emperor, the Wei government appointed Sima Yi as a Palace Attendant and Manager of the Affairs of the Masters of Writing, granted him imperial authority, and ordered him to oversee military affairs within and outside the imperial capital Luoyang. Sima Yi and Cao Shuang each held command over 3,000 troops and served as regents for the underage emperor. As Cao Shuang wanted the Masters of Writing (i.e. the Imperial Secretariat) to report to him first, he proposed to the imperial court to reassign Sima Yi to be the Grand Marshal. As the persons who previously held the position of Grand Marshal all died in office, the imperial court thought that it would be more appropriate to appoint Sima Yi as Grand Tutor instead. Sima Yi was also awarded additional privileges similar to those granted to Xiao He in the early Western Han dynasty and Cao Cao in the late Eastern Han dynasty: He did not have to walk briskly when he entered the imperial court, did not have to have his name announced when he entered, and was allowed to wear shoes and carry a sword into the imperial court. His eldest son, Sima Shi, was appointed as a Regular Mounted Attendant, while three of his relatives were enfeoffed as marquises and four others were appointed as Cavalry Commandants. Sima Yi ordered his relatives to decline the honours and appointments.\nIn the spring of 239, the Wa, Karasahr, Weixu states and the Xianbei tribes living south of the Ruo River came to pay tribute to the Cao Wei state. Cao Fang attributed this to the efforts of his subjects and he rewarded Sima Yi by increasing the number of taxable households in his marquisate.Sima Yi also suggested that the Wei imperial court put an end to the extravagant palace construction/renovation projects started in Cao Rui's reign, and divert those resources and manpower towards agriculture instead. The imperial court approved.</font>",
"acLiangBiographyScrollPopupViewDesc5-7":"<font size=20>In July 251, when Sima Yi became critically ill, he dreamt of Jia Kui and Wang Ling being honoured, and he felt disturbed after that. He died on 7 September 251 in Luoyang at the age of 73 (by East Asian age reckoning). The emperor, Cao Fang, donned mourning garments, attended Sima Yi's funeral in person, and even ordered Sima Yi to be buried with the same honours as those accorded to Huo Guang in the Western Han dynasty. He also posthumously appointed Sima Yi as Chancellor of State and posthumously elevated him to the status of a duke. However, Sima Yi's younger brother, Sima Fu, declined the ducal title and a wenliangche on behalf of his deceased brother, stating that Sima Yi would have done that if he were still alive.\nSima Yi was buried on 19 October 251 at Heyin County. Before his death, Sima Yi had made arrangements to be buried at Mount Shouyang with no markers (e.g. tombstone, trees) around his tomb, to be dressed in plain clothes, and have no luxury items buried with him. He also made a rule stating that his family members who died after him should not be buried with him. \nAfter Sima Yi's death, his eldest son, Sima Shi, assumed his father's authority up until his own death on 23 March 255, after which Sima Yi's second eldest son, Sima Zhao, took up his elder brother's position. On 2 May 264, when the Wei emperor, Cao Huan, enfeoffed Sima Zhao as the vassal [King of Jin], Sima Zhao went on to honour his father with the posthumous title [Prince/King Xuan of Jin]. Sima Zhao died on 6 September 265, and his eldest son, Sima Yan, succeeded him in his position. By the next year, in 266, after Sima Yi's grandson, Sima Yan, usurped the throne from Cao Huan and established the Jin dynasty with himself as the emperor, he honoured his grandfather with the posthumous title [Emperor Xuan of Jin].</font>",

"sweetgiftTalk1_1-1":"You walked out of the mansion with the cakes you just made and decided to go to the Hut to visit Old Feng. You see that Old Feng is sitting in the courtyard.",
"sweetgiftTalk1_2-1":"Oh... Welcome! Please take a cup of hot tea and have a rest!",
"sweetgiftTalk1_3-1":"Here are some cakes I just made.",
"sweetgiftTalk1_4-1":"Thank you for your cakes.",
"sweetgiftTalk1_5-1":"You took out a cake and place it on the table respectfully. Old Feng took one, smiled and nodded, and then started the conversation.",
"sweetgiftTalk2_1-1":"The night was getting darker, the moon was hanging high. The carriage went slowly, you finally reach the Private School.",
"sweetgiftTalk2_2-1":"Although it was late night, the school was still brightly lit and students were studying. You gently opened the wooden door. Tang Bohu smiled and closed his book.",
"sweetgiftTalk2_3-1":"Your Highness brough light to our school. Welcome. What can I do for you?",
"sweetgiftTalk2_4-1":"You educated people, and cultivated many talents for the country. We knew your achievement. I have prepared some cakes for you. Here you are.",
"sweetgiftTalk2_5-1":"A group of young students ran to you excitingly and happily. Tang Bohu couldn't stop them. You placed the cake box on the table and distribute them to the Children and then gave a piece of cake to Tang Bo hu.",
"sweetgiftTalk2_6-1":"Look, Mr. Tang, how happy they are. Students are the future.",
"sweetgiftTalk2_7-1":"Yes. The future are awesome.",
"sweetgiftTalk2_8-1":"You two laughed loudly. The academy was filled with a happy atmosphere.",
"sweetgiftTalk3_1-1":"On the way to the Prospect Garden, the fog was getting stronger. You seemed to see one or two cute white rabbits skipping from the side of the road, they disappeared into the fog. Rabbit?",
"sweetgiftTalk3_2-1":"You reached the Prospect Garden. You went out of the car and wanted to send someone to report your coming. Then, a greeting came from the back.",
"sweetgiftTalk3_3-1":"Oh, Your Highness! Please come in. Welcome.",
"sweetgiftTalk3_4-1":"I've not seen you guys for a while. How are you recently? How about Jia Mu? I have prepared some cakes for you. Please accept it.",
"sweetgiftTalk3_5-1":"Thank you, my lord. We appreciate it. Our master Jia Mu is quite well! Her birthday is coming. We are preparing for it.",
"sweetgiftTalk3_6-1":"Take a break and try some cakes.",
"sweetgiftTalk3_7-1":"Thank you for your gift!",
"sweetgiftTalk4_1-1":"The fog around was thicker. It was so strange. You stoped and got out of the car, it's outside the Yong's Mansion.",
"sweetgiftTalk4_2-1":"But Yong's mansion shouldn't be on this road. Alright, you happened to pass by Yong's mansion, it is better to visit Prince Baylor, maybe this thick fog will disperse.",
"sweetgiftTalk4_3-1":"The servant leaded you enter the mansion and go to Prince Baylor. It turned out that Prince Baylor was drinking alone here. Seeing you coming over, he stood up and laughed and waved to you.",
"sweetgiftTalk4_4-1":"It's good to see you tonight. Look at the full moon. It's so round and bright. Cheers!",
"sweetgiftTalk4_5-1":"The fog is so thick tonight. We got lost and happened to pass by, so I dropped in.",
"sweetgiftTalk4_6-1":"Hahaha, are you joking? Look, the stars are shining, the moon is bright, the weather is very good tonight, where is the fog?",
"sweetgiftTalk4_7-1":"You were shocked and look around. It seemed that since entering the palace, the fog disappeared. So strange. Prince Baylor seemed to know something. He gently clapped their hands.",
"sweetgiftTalk4_8-1":"It's been said that when you meet thick fog which can be seen by you only at night, the fog is auspicious. You can meet the fairy tonight. Oh, how great it is!",
"sweetgiftTalk4_9-1":"Hearing this, you think of the rabbit. So you got up and said goodbye to Prince Baylor.",
"sweetgiftTalk4_10-1":"I made some cakes for you, Prince Baylor. Please accept them.",
"sweetgiftTalk4_11-1":"Prince Baylor took the cake box and smiled, raised the glass and drank it. You said goodbye to Prince Baylor, turned and left.",
"sweetgiftTalk4_12-1":"Just as you stepped out of the mansion and the fog immediately came and surrounded. You took a few more steps and saw a golden light breaking through the thick fog, sprinkling from the moon, making a ladder in front of your feet.",
"sweetgiftTalk5_1-1":"When you just stepped on the golden light, Golden Light took it back and flew into the air with you. The moon is getting bigger and bigger, and a palace emerges on it. In a blink of an eye, building fall to the door of the temple.",
"sweetgiftTalk5_2-1":"The palace is neither large nor tall, and is similar in size to your mansion, but the houses and buildings are carved and painted, and the tiles and windows and doors are shimmering with soft golden light.",
"sweetgiftTalk5_3-1":"As you slowly moved forward, you can enjoy the Beauty of the scenes. You walked through the front hall and came to the main hall of the palace, where a Beautiful fairy was dancing.",
"sweetgiftTalk5_4-1":"You finally came, my lord. I've been waiting for your for so long.",
"sweetgiftTalk5_5-1":"Cheng'e, it's you. Where are we?",
"sweetgiftTalk5_6-1":"This is my previous residence, the palace of the moon.",
"sweetgiftTalk5_7-1":"I take this opportunity to lead you visit this palace. There are no other people living here though, you can still see the Beautiful pavilion and scenes. Please enjoy it.",
"sweetgiftTalk5_8-1":"Good! I have handled a lot of official duties these days, and I am quite tired. Take a break here. Let's spend the night together in this Moon Palace.",
"sweetgiftTalk5_9-1":"(Reluctantly lean over and hold your arm) Yes, my lord...",

Lords may dispatch your Beauties to compete in artistic talents and outstand here, along with other Beauties of other Lords.\n\n<font color=0x00ff00>[The Contesting Beauties]</font> Only ennobled Beauties (with current status of Loyal Lover or above) are qualified to the Contest. Ennobled Beauties will be dispatched according to the ascending order of Talent.\n\n<font color=0x00ff00>[Contest Rules]</font> Dispatched Beauties contest with each other according to the value of Talent, which reduces while contesting. The Beauty whose Talent reaches zero is defeated, and the next Beauty will be dispatched and continue to contest until all Beauties on one side are defeated.\n\n<font color=0x00ff00>[Winning Streak Limitation]</font> Any Beauty winning three rounds in a row will automatically quit due to exhaustion.\n\n<font color=0x00ff00>[Victory Rewards]</font> After victory, Lords will acquire Beauty Contest Points and Beauty Contest Scores. Points are used for ranking while Scores can be used for redeeming various items. Each time a Beauty on the opponent side is defeated, you will get two Points. After a Contest, the victor gets 30 Points and the loser gets 10 Points. The Scores equals to the Points you have acquired.\n\n<font color=0x00ff00>[Challengers Matchup]</font> The system will automatically match 4 challengers for you, within an interval of 1 hour. Lords may also use Beauty Contest Token to search for a challenger immediately.\n\n<font color=0x00ff00>[Talent and Bonus]</font> A Beauty’s Talent equals to (Affinity*2+Charm*2+Artistic*6)*(1+Ennoble Bonus). Ennobling Beauties will enhance the Talent value of all Beauties. The more Beauties are ennobled, the higher the bonus will be. During the Ranking, Lords can acquire an enormous amount of temporary extra Talent by enhancing Artistic. The more Artistic enhanced, the larger the increment of extra Talent will be. However, this extra value does not enjoy the bonus of ennobling. <font color=0xfedb38>In the Talent Bonus page, the green fonts in brackets display the temporary extra Talent. This extra value will be removed when the event ends. The Talent displayed in the Beauty page does not count the extra part.</font>\n\n<font color=0x00ff00>[Encyclopedia]</font> Lords may use Points to redeem Encyclopedia Fragments, use these Fragments to learn various Books in the Encyclopedia and upgrade the corresponding Retainer’s Books. The learning of Encyclopedia is restricted by the amount of ennobled Beauties. Even though corresponding Retainer is not acquired, the learning is still available for Lords. However, the Book Level will not take effect until the acquisition of corresponding Retainer.\n\n<font color=0x00ff00>[Banishment]</font>Beauty Contest is not related to Banishment feature. Banished Beauties will show up as challengers and will be challenged.</font>",

"acTravelWithBeautyRewardTalk_4_1-3":"I guess you are a bit tired. What about taking a rest here and have a light meal?",
"acTravelWithBeautyRewardTalk_4_2-3":"How gentle you are, my Lord! [Wenjun is about to feed you with a flower cake] Would you like to have a taste?",
"acTravelWithBeautyRewardTalk_4_3-3":"Your delicate hand seems to make these ordinary flower cakes much more delicious and fragrant!",
"acTravelWithBeautyRewardTalk_4_4-3":"[Wenjun bows her head shily] I am flattered, my Lord~",
"acTravelWithBeautyRewardTalk_5_1-3":"It is such a fantastic day for me to visit this wonderful scene with my Lord! I am so delighted but wonder if there is another perfect day with you!",
"acTravelWithBeautyRewardTalk_5_2-3":"I will stay by your side every night and day if you don't mind!",
"acTravelWithBeautyRewardTalk_5_3-3":"[Wenjun leans her head on your shoulder] I wish to be your breeze in summer days and your overcoat in winter nights!",


"searchStoryDialog_101001001":"There is recently a renovated garden in Yong's Mansion where ministers are invited to the banquet. Enchanted by the Beauty of the later Spring, you lose your way and bump into someone.",
"searchStoryDialog_101001002":"Ouch.",
"searchStoryDialog_101001003":"Your manners.",
"searchStoryDialog_101001004":"You notice that there is one more person in the huge garden. He has a fine black dress, an imposing manner and a pair of cold eyes. His lips are slightly closed.",
"searchStoryDialog_101001005":"Such a fine dress. Such a free walk in the yard. He's presumably Lord Yong's beloved Child, Xiao Yixing.",
"searchStoryDialog_101001006":"I'm awfully sorry to run into Prince His Excellency.",
"searchStoryDialog_101001007":"Heads up.",
"searchStoryDialog_101001008":"You look up at Xiao, meeting his cold eyes. Although he smiles, but there is no warmth in the eyes. His cold eyes scan your body, which gives you a chill. You lower your head and dare not look again.",
"searchStoryDialog_101001009":"Get up. Today, I really had a wonderful time in the garden. I'll spare you.",
"searchStoryDialog_101001010":"Thank you, Your Highness.",
"searchStoryDialog_101001011":"You stand up, feeling Xiao Yixing measuring you. You find yourself an excuse and leave.",
"searchStoryDialog_101002001":"Today, you go to play chess in Yong's Mansion. It takes only three more rounds to defeat Xiao Yixing. You land a piece upon contemplation.",
"searchStoryDialog_101002002":"Xiao Yixing seems surprised to see that move. He looks up at you, smiles and lands one piece.",
"searchStoryDialog_101002003":"You won.",
"searchStoryDialog_101002004":"Sixth Lord has superb skills in chess. I admit inferiority.",
"searchStoryDialog_101002005":"This chess game is just a game, as Sixth Lord has designed how it will end. I'll accept it.",
"searchStoryDialog_101002006":"(Satisfied) Most people who play chess with me will fix the game, but you are different.",
"searchStoryDialog_101002007":"I am more than content. You can come and play chess with me often.",
"searchStoryDialog_101003001":"It is a fine day. And you decide to go out because of your great mood. You can't help but let fly your inspirations of poetry on the platform.",
"searchStoryDialog_101003002":"Where talents gather, A Beautiful dream of flying bears.",
"searchStoryDialog_101003003":"Where breeze blows, A sorrowful song of hundred birds.",
"searchStoryDialog_101003004":"Impressive talent of Prince His Highness.",
"searchStoryDialog_101003005":"Xiao Yixing leans against the rail and smiles, ",
"searchStoryDialog_101003006":"The fine weather is rare. Can't waste it.",
"searchStoryDialog_101003007":"Why not compose a poem and live to the fullest of the Spring time.",
"searchStoryDialog_101003008":"You and Xiao Yixing compose poems in returns. Whenever you come up with a good line, Xiao Yixing would respond with admiration.",
"searchStoryDialog_101004001":"One day, Prince receives a treasure and he invites ministers to appreciate its Beauty. You pretend to be sick but still are invited by Xiao Yixing's servant at the third request.",
"searchStoryDialog_101004002":"I heard that you are ill, Your Excellency. I wonder what troubles you?",
"searchStoryDialog_101004003":"Cough. I caught a cold by accident. Thanks for Prince's concern. Cough. ",
"searchStoryDialog_101004004":"I'll take the pulse.",
"searchStoryDialog_101004005":"You want to shirk, but Xiao Yixing's eyes would not allow. You hold back what you wanna say.",
"searchStoryDialog_101004006":"He has a thin callus on his finger, causing your tender skin to feel itchy as it moves along.",
"searchStoryDialog_101004007":"Your wrist is much smaller than that of an ordinary man.",
"searchStoryDialog_101004008":"I'm not finished yet.",
"searchStoryDialog_101004009":"Then he holds your wrist again. You blush and draw back your hand, with his temperature lingering.",
"searchStoryDialog_101004010":"Xiao Yixing looks at you with a playful way, reaching out to touch your cheek. Scared, you take a few steps back.",
"searchStoryDialog_101004011":"You feel hot. Looks like you are quite ill. Just go back and have a good rest.",
"searchStoryDialog_101004012":"You prostrate and then return.",
"searchStoryDialog_101005001":"Last night, you did not sleep well, so you take a sleepy walk back, only to be tripped by a brick.",
"searchStoryDialog_101005002":"A strong arm holds you, scooping you into arms. Across the clothes, you can feel his warm, thick chest, hands unconsciously put around his waist.",
"searchStoryDialog_101005003":"You look up and see Xiao Yixing staring at you with interest.",
"searchStoryDialog_101005004":"Thank... Thank you, Your Highness.",
"searchStoryDialog_101005005":"You step back out of his arms and prostrate.",
"searchStoryDialog_101005006":"(Laughter) If you are tired, Your Excellency, it is better to take my palanquin.",
"searchStoryDialog_101005007":"Say yes.",
"searchStoryDialog_101005008":"You are too sleepy to walk or show manners. You thank Xiao Yixing and take his ride. And Xiao Yixing is now with you.",
"searchStoryDialog_101005009":"The pillow cushion is so comfortable that you fall asleep quickly. Someone seems to give a kiss to your forehead in your sleep, and you rub it on the pillow.",
"searchStoryDialog_101005010":"Say no.",
"searchStoryDialog_101005011":"You feel it very wrong to ride along with the Prince, so you turn down his offer.",
"searchStoryDialog_101005012":"If so, join me for a walk.",
"searchStoryDialog_101005013":"Xiao Yixing walks before you reply. You have a pleasant talk on the way, and you come to realize he's got discerning eyes behind his overbearing manner.",
"searchStoryDialog_101006001":"One day, you go to a tea house to watch an opera. A servant whispers in your ear and points a direction where you see Xiao Yixing putting on his faint smile and staring at you.",
"searchStoryDialog_101006002":"You come up and prostrate before Xiao Yixing who signals you to sit down and closer. On the stage, the character of Female Consort Prince has won the top scholar award and is going to attend conferment.",
"searchStoryDialog_101006003":"The Female Consort Prince is merely a folklore or lese-majeste otherwise.",
"searchStoryDialog_101006004":"Were there to be a way out, the lady wouldn't have done so.",
"searchStoryDialog_101006005":"(Sighs) Peace a little more is absurdity much less.",
"searchStoryDialog_101006006":"Life is a drama A drama is life.",
"searchStoryDialog_101006007":"Xiao Yixing seems to be referring to something as he stares at you. You lower your head to the tea, pretending you can't read his eyes.",
"searchStoryDialog_101007001":"One day, you take out a Zither. Feeling it boring to play at home, you ask servants to move it to the garden.",
"searchStoryDialog_101007002":"In the middle of your play, you are accompanied by Xiao Yixing's bamboo flute.",
"searchStoryDialog_101007003":"When the tune ends, you stand up and prostrate.",
"searchStoryDialog_101007004":"Wouldn't think Your Excellency could play so well.",
"searchStoryDialog_101007005":"I'm flattered. Your music is melodious and pleasant to ears.",
"searchStoryDialog_101007006":"You pluck the strings and start playing again.",
"searchStoryDialog_101007007":"I've composed a tune lately. It's called Summer. But I feel something is missing in the tune.",
"searchStoryDialog_101007008":"Xiao stands against the rail, listening to your play and think for a while. In a while, the bamboo flute joins the Zither and produces sweet sounds.",
"searchStoryDialog_101008001":"One day, you pay a visit to Yong's Mansion. You nod off perhaps you didn't sleep well last night. You wake up accompanied by Xiao who's staring at you.",
"searchStoryDialog_101008002":"I mean no offense.",
"searchStoryDialog_101008003":"None taken. You've been doing great things to the country. It's naturally exhausting.",
"searchStoryDialog_101008004":"You merely respond with a smile.",
"searchStoryDialog_101008005":"You have a pretty face and a pretty smile.",
"searchStoryDialog_101008006":"You put on a grave look.",
"searchStoryDialog_101008007":"Xiao laughs. It's the first time you've seen him laugh. The curve of his face becomes smooth.",
"searchStoryDialog_101008008":"(Chuckles) Are you not awake yet? You look dumbheaded.",
"searchStoryDialog_101008009":"(Flurried) Sorry for my ill manners. It's getting late. I'll be leaving.",
"searchStoryDialog_101008010":"Your servants have been waiting outside already. You bid farewell to the Sixth Prince and return.",
"searchStoryDialog_101009001":"One day, you go out for a walk to get rid of worries, only to fall into a pond, absent-minded.",
"searchStoryDialog_101009002":"You take off your clothes and shower. But a few words drifting in from the distance prompt you to grab a piece and hide behind a tree.",
"searchStoryDialog_101009003":"Suddenly, you are covered by a coat. Xiao comes out of nowhere and is looking at you confoundedly.",
"searchStoryDialog_101009004":"With only two pieces on, you feel shy and scared, not knowing what to do. Finally, Xiao utters a word.",
"searchStoryDialog_101009005":"Lese-majeste.",
"searchStoryDialog_101009006":"(Crying) What are you gonna do with me?",
"searchStoryDialog_101009007":"(Chuckles) You sound like a sweet girl.",
"searchStoryDialog_101009008":"He helps you get dressed, carries you in arms and walks out of the woods.",
"searchStoryDialog_101009009":"(Afraid) Where are you going, Your Highness?",
"searchStoryDialog_101009010":"My mansion first. I'll send a servant to summon you there later...",
"searchStoryDialog_101009011":"Then I will take an empty palanquin back?",
"searchStoryDialog_101009012":"There is a [yes] look from Xiao's eyes.",
"searchStoryDialog_101009013":"(Satisfied) You are clever. We'll go back to your Lese-majeste when we arrive there.",
"searchStoryDialog_101010001":"Xiao has never brought the matter up since he sent you back. You're in suspense all day. One day, Yong's Mansion sends someone to summon you.",
"searchStoryDialog_101010002":"(Soliloquise) Take it as it may come.",
"searchStoryDialog_101010003":"Xiao has been waiting in the Hall. It's only you and him now.",
"searchStoryDialog_101010004":"Admit offense",
"searchStoryDialog_101010005":"(Afraid) Please spare my life, Your Highness. There's a story behind it.",
"searchStoryDialog_101010006":"Whatever it is, lese-majeste is a capital crime.",
"searchStoryDialog_101010007":"Still, you've been an uncorrupted and competent officer. ",
"searchStoryDialog_101010008":"Wait till he brings it up",
"searchStoryDialog_101010009":"Silence is gold. It's better not to reply until Xiao brings it up.",
"searchStoryDialog_101010010":"Although you take the office by disguising yourself as a man, you've contributed to the imperial court by remaining uncorrupted.",
"searchStoryDialog_101010011":"However, the imperial court is not where you decide a case.",
"searchStoryDialog_101010012":"Xiao beats about the bush and you can't really follow him.",
"searchStoryDialog_101010013":"Please enlighten me, Your Highness.",
"searchStoryDialog_101010014":"You are a rising star in the court. If you take the right side, I will go easy on you.",
"searchStoryDialog_101010015":"I see. I will go through fire and water for Your Highness.",
"searchStoryDialog_101010016":"You release a long sigh. Lord Yong holds an important position in the imperial court. Taking Xiao's side will make things a lot easier.",
"searchStoryDialog_101011001":"One day, you go into the woods to relax, only to reach the depths of the woods. There seem to be a few shadows and gossips.",
"searchStoryDialog_101011002":"Upset and lost in directions, you don't feel like any conversations. You decide to leave but you step on a twig that cracks.",
"searchStoryDialog_101011003":"You catch sight of a shadow coming up to you. Then you get knocked over, with a sharp blade next to your neck.",
"searchStoryDialog_101011004":"Fake death",
"searchStoryDialog_101011005":"You close your eyes and pretend to have passed out. Then someone turns you over.",
"searchStoryDialog_101011006":"????? : Why is it you?",
"searchStoryDialog_101011007":"You recognize Xiao's voice, wondering why he would appear in the woods out of reach.",
"searchStoryDialog_101011008":"His big hand fixes your hair and pinches your cheek.",
"searchStoryDialog_101011009":"Somehow, you just make my mind wander.",
"searchStoryDialog_101011010":"You close your eyes and do not dare to move. After a while, Xiao summons servants to send you home.",
"searchStoryDialog_101011011":"Beg for mercy",
"searchStoryDialog_101011012":"Please forgive me!",
"searchStoryDialog_101011013":"Why is it you?",
"searchStoryDialog_101011014":"You recognize Xiao's voice and hurry to prostrate. He frowns at you and sighs.",
"searchStoryDialog_101011015":"Forget it, tell nobody about this.",
"searchStoryDialog_101011016":"He stands up, reaching out his hand toward you, and you look confounded.",
"searchStoryDialog_101011017":"What are you waiting for? Return with me.",
"searchStoryDialog_101012001":"It is a sunny day and you are having a conversation with Xiao over tea, not accompanied by the servants.",
"searchStoryDialog_101012002":"I…",
"searchStoryDialog_101012003":"Feel free to talk when there's nobody around.",
"searchStoryDialog_101012004":"That's improper.",
"searchStoryDialog_101012005":"But disguising yourself as a man is proper?",
"searchStoryDialog_101012006":"You are rendered speechless. Xiao laughs.",
"searchStoryDialog_101012007":"Don't forget that I got your back. And you do as I say.",
"searchStoryDialog_101012008":"Obedience is better than politeness. ",
"searchStoryDialog_101012009":"Huh?",
"searchStoryDialog_101012010":"His chin supported by one hand, he puts on an enchanting smile.",
"searchStoryDialog_101012011":"I... I got it...",
"searchStoryDialog_101012012":"Although Xiao says that he keeps the secret to rope you in, lese-majeste is a felony. Conviction leads to the implication of nine degrees of kinship.",
"searchStoryDialog_101012013":"He wouldn't have taken the risk just to expand his influence over the court.",
"searchStoryDialog_101012014":"So... What is that for>",
"searchStoryDialog_101013001":"At the sight of your delicate constitution, Xiao brings you to the Drill Ground, saying he wants to teach you some martial moves.",
"searchStoryDialog_101013002":"Squat down. Right fist forward.",
"searchStoryDialog_101013003":"He walks around you as you pose the stance. Then he approaches your back and you can feel his hot breath.",
"searchStoryDialog_101013004":"Level left fist with waist. Right hand back. Left hand forward...",
"searchStoryDialog_101013005":"He guides your moves from behind. You are close. But you are too dizzy that you can't hear a thing of his...",
"searchStoryDialog_101014001":"One day, Xiao summons you. You are led by a servant into the room. Xiao has been waiting there, with a sandalwooden box in his hand.",
"searchStoryDialog_101014002":"Come here to me.",
"searchStoryDialog_101014003":"So you do obediently.",
"searchStoryDialog_101014004":"Do you know what this is?",
"searchStoryDialog_101014005":"You shake your head. Xiao opens the box and takes out a delicate emerald bracelet that is almost transparent and fine in material.",
"searchStoryDialog_101014006":"He takes your hand and put it on. It fits just well.",
"searchStoryDialog_101014007":"Last time when I took your hand, I feel there ought to be something. So, I ordered craftsmen to make this bracelet. You like it?",
"searchStoryDialog_101014008":"Yes, but it's...",
"searchStoryDialog_101014009":"No one has ever said [No] before me.",
"searchStoryDialog_101014010":"Thanks, Your Highness...",
"searchStoryDialog_101014011":"You feel uneasy. But others would've gone into raptures. And you don't know how to respond to this relationship...",
"searchStoryDialog_101015001":"One day, Li His Excellency would like you to drink where ladies would be there. You go inside because you have to. It doesn't take long before you see a familiar guy who walks towards you, angry.",
"searchStoryDialog_101015002":"How bold.",
"searchStoryDialog_101015003":"There is wrath in his words. Xiao drags you over shivering Li His Excellency, into a private room, glaring at you.",
"searchStoryDialog_101015004":"Explain",
"searchStoryDialog_101015005":"I'm just here to talk business. I didn't intend to invite those girls.",
"searchStoryDialog_101015006":"(Groan) You'd better try once!",
"searchStoryDialog_101015007":"Stay quiet",
"searchStoryDialog_101015008":"(Angry) Why? You have the guts to drink wines with girls but not to speak?",
"searchStoryDialog_101015009":"You can see that he is furious. You bow head and do not dare to say anything.",
"searchStoryDialog_101015010":"(Groaning) Is it my wishful thinking?",
"searchStoryDialog_101015011":"Xiao turns around and is about to go. You know that if he leaves like that, you two will be together no more.",
"searchStoryDialog_101015012":"Thinking of that, you take a deep breath and make a decision.",
"searchStoryDialog_101015013":"Xiao Yixing! It is not your wishful thinking…",
"searchStoryDialog_101015014":"Xiao turns around and hugs you, with a gratified smile.",
"searchStoryDialog_101015015":"Dumbhead, I knew it. You just need a push.",
"searchStoryDialog_101015016":"He touches your head and you feel this while is worth everything.",
"searchStoryDialog_101016001":"One day, Xiao Yixing summons you and a servant leads you to a side room. There is only Xiao Yixing inside, with a table of snacks.",
"searchStoryDialog_101016002":"I learned from my last visit that you love these stuff. So, I asked them to prepare some.",
"searchStoryDialog_101016003":"He naturally takes your hand and sits down by the table.",
"searchStoryDialog_101016004":"I do not know what you like to eat, so I bought one for each category.",
"searchStoryDialog_101016005":"You are much touched to see the plums, jujubes and sugar-coated haws. You don't know how to express thanks.",
"searchStoryDialog_101016006":"Kiss him.",
"searchStoryDialog_101016007":"You give him a quick kiss on the cheek when he isn't noticing.",
"searchStoryDialog_101016008":"Xiao seems surprised, and there is a smile in his face.",
"searchStoryDialog_101016009":"(Gentle) It seems that I'm supposed to prepare more snacks.",
"searchStoryDialog_101016010":"Thank verbally",
"searchStoryDialog_101016011":"(Moved) They're delicious. Thank you.",
"searchStoryDialog_101016012":"Never mind.",
"searchStoryDialog_101016013":"You put one sugar-coated haw in your mouth, looking satisfied with the sour and sweet flavor. Xiao looks at you with affection.",
"searchStoryDialog_101017001":"Rumor is that Princess Gulun, Prince Gong's beloved daughter, is frequently seen in Yong's Mansion and their marriage is around the corner.",
"searchStoryDialog_101017002":"You feel somewhat sad. Xiao invites you three or four times, only to be rejected by you.",
"searchStoryDialog_101017003":"I'm not feeling well. Please tell His Highness that I can't pay a visit.",
"searchStoryDialog_101017004":"What's wrong with you?",
"searchStoryDialog_101017005":"You are startled. There is only Xiao in the hall who disguised as the messenger guard. Others are nowhere to be found.",
"searchStoryDialog_101017006":"(Panic) Why... Why are you here?",
"searchStoryDialog_101017007":"I have to see you in person since you rejected me so many times.",
"searchStoryDialog_101017008":"You turn your back and do not speak.",
"searchStoryDialog_101017009":"Let me guess, it's Princess Gulun, isn't it?",
"searchStoryDialog_101017010":"He scoops you into the arms. You wanna break free but fail.",
"searchStoryDialog_101017011":"(Sighs) I will handle this matter. No use overthinking. I never lied to you.",
"searchStoryDialog_101017012":"Xiao Yixing holds you tighter, and you want him to hold you for a little longer, and longer.",
"searchStoryDialog_101018001":"One day when you are appreciating the scenery with Xiao Yixing, you suddenly recollect the appearance of Xiao in the woods. You ask him why.",
"searchStoryDialog_101018002":"You're so smart. Take a guess.",
"searchStoryDialog_101018003":"Is there a spy in the woods delivering messages?",
"searchStoryDialog_101018004":"There is admiration in his eyes. He rubs your nose lovingly. Your nose is somewhat warm.",
"searchStoryDialog_101018005":"(Smile) You're so smart. It's great that you don't run counter to me.",
"searchStoryDialog_101018006":"My informant is not supposed to appear in the city. But the intelligence is confidential and no mistake is allowed.",
"searchStoryDialog_101018007":"You nod in agreement. Face-on-face conveyance is practical. Still, you look surprised when Xiao tells you such a confidential matter.",
"searchStoryDialog_101019001":"One day, you go on the streets with Xiao in plain clothes and without servants. There is some guy selling the sugar-coated haws. And you look at them several times.",
"searchStoryDialog_101019002":"So, you want the sugar-coated haws?",
"searchStoryDialog_101019003":"Yes, I do",
"searchStoryDialog_101019004":"(Upset) They were my Childhood favorites. Too bad that something happened to my family and no one would buy them for me.",
"searchStoryDialog_101019005":"No, I don't",
"searchStoryDialog_101019006":"It's an improper manner to eat the sugar-coated haws as we walk on the street. ",
"searchStoryDialog_101019007":"(Chuckles) Oh?",
"searchStoryDialog_101019008":"Anything you ask, I'll give it to you.",
"searchStoryDialog_101019009":"You look up at Xiao Yixing. He is an honorable prince while you are an unconvicted criminal.",
"searchStoryDialog_101019010":"You're not in the mood to hang out, upon thinking of that.",
"searchStoryDialog_101020001":"One day, Xiao summons you. And you see Xiao Yixing holding a casket in hand.",
"searchStoryDialog_101020002":"Xiao signals you to sit down. Then a cold piece is attached to your chest. It turns out to be a jade pendant.",
"searchStoryDialog_101020003":"That's...",
"searchStoryDialog_101020004":"(Smile) This is the ancestral jade pendant of my mother.",
"searchStoryDialog_101020005":"Two years ago, Mom told me to put it on the destined one.",
"searchStoryDialog_101020006":"Now, this is yours.",
"searchStoryDialog_101020007":"The title might be a difficult thing. But you have to know my love.",
"searchStoryDialog_101020008":"You are too moved to speak. The jade pendant seems to be warmed. Xiao hugs you from behind, scooping you tightly to his chest.",
"searchStoryDialog_101020009":"I will not fail you this whole life.",
"searchStoryDialog_101021001":"On the Mid-autumn Banquet, it's lucky that you get to sit next to His Highness. Against the bright moon in the sky, you raise a goblet towards Xiao Yixing.",
"searchStoryDialog_101021002":"(Tipsy) I propose a toast to you.",
"searchStoryDialog_101021003":"You gaze at him as Xiao raises the cup. He's putting on a plain look.",
"searchStoryDialog_101021004":"(Then with a smile) A reunion in golden autumn outweighs everything.",
"searchStoryDialog_101021005":"The atmosphere, the words and his pretty eyebrows, all make you forget who you are at the power of alcohol.",
"searchStoryDialog_101021006":"(Shy) If love between both sides can last for aye, why need they stay together night and day?",
"searchStoryDialog_101021007":"(Nod with satisfaction) It's great that you can understand it.",
"searchStoryDialog_101022001":"It's been a prosperous place traditionally, featuring tender willows and busy shops As you newly take the office, you decide to hang around. Horseshoe rings are heard from the distance. Two rows of guards are followed by a line of men and horses going in Yong's Mansion's direction.",
"searchStoryDialog_101022002":"In the middle of the guards is a dignitary man dressed in a dark-colored robe. His pretty face seems to be suggesting he's smiling or contemplating.",
"searchStoryDialog_101022003":"People are discussing in a low voice. He seems to be the guard of the prince of Yong's Mansion. And the guy shifts his eyes here, as if he has heard something.",
"searchStoryDialog_101022004":"This glimpse flusters you. But you can't help looking at him. The horses and men are gone. So is he.",
"searchStoryDialog_101022005":"You recollect that he is the Prince His Excellency of Yong's Mansion, deciding that you will find him if you can go to Yong's Mansion.",
"searchStoryDialog_201001001":"One day, you are summoned to Yong's Mansion and led to a pavilion in a garden. Princess Heshuo looks displeased at you, with her lips curled.",
"searchStoryDialog_201001002":"(Grumble coyly) Hmph, it's been long since you last played with me. I had to summon you in order to see you.",
"searchStoryDialog_201001003":"You make your apology reverently and Princess Heshuo stomps her feet.",
"searchStoryDialog_201001004":"I arranged for my maids to keep watch.",
"searchStoryDialog_201001005":"You read it from her lines. You walk over, sit down on a stone stool and scoop Princess Heshuo onto your legs.",
"searchStoryDialog_201001006":"I've been busy recently. I was gonna find you after all this. As soon as you summoned me, I immediately came.",
"searchStoryDialog_201001007":"(Coy) Do you... Do you miss me?",
"searchStoryDialog_201001008":"Yes, of course I do. Every moment of the day.",
"searchStoryDialog_201001009":"You hold her tighter and rub her little nose with your finger. She blushes and says no more.",
"searchStoryDialog_102001001":"One day when you review the documents, you fall asleep without knowing it. You wake up, noticing a coat covering you.",
"searchStoryDialog_102001002":"The door squeaks and your Senior Brother Gu Qingfeng comes in with a bowl of White Fungus Soup.",
"searchStoryDialog_102001003":"(Chuckles) You up? White Fungus Soup is ready. Drink while it's not cold.",
"searchStoryDialog_102001004":"Autumn is cool. Pay more attention to your health.",
"searchStoryDialog_102001005":"You and him grew up together since young. He's always been there for you, taking the best care of you.",
"searchStoryDialog_102001006":"Look, the ink is running to your face.",
"searchStoryDialog_102001007":"He draws closer as he wipes your face. But the distance is so short that you can feel his breath.",
"searchStoryDialog_102001008":"Before you make a sound to remind him, he steps back.",
"searchStoryDialog_102001009":"(Shy) Thank you, brother.",
"searchStoryDialog_102001010":"He touches your head and smiles tenderly. His laugh is his name, breeze.",
"searchStoryDialog_102002001":"When you return home from the daytime work, you can smell the food from afar.",
"searchStoryDialog_102002002":"Gu Qingfeng is reading a book at the table with a light. There are two or three of your favorite dishes. At the sight of you coming in, he stands up and brings a bowl of soup for you.",
"searchStoryDialog_102002003":"First drink a bowl of soup to warm the stomach.",
"searchStoryDialog_102002004":"Soup drunk, you feel that half of the tiredness seems to be gone. And the dishes are still not cold. You look at him in surprise.",
"searchStoryDialog_102002005":"(Tenderly) I let the servant wait at the door, so I know it when you come back. The kitchen will heat the dishes for you to eat the moment you return.",
"searchStoryDialog_102002006":"Thank you, Senior Brother. You've been so kind to me.",
"searchStoryDialog_102002007":"It's sheer luck of whoever that can marry you.",
"searchStoryDialog_102002008":"(Laugh) Nonsense. Eat. The food is getting cold.",
"searchStoryDialog_102002009":"You are so tired and hungry that you lower your head and eat. Gu Qingfeng smiles and shakes his head, sitting back by the table to resume reading his book.",
"searchStoryDialog_102002010":"Feels like being under watch...",
"searchStoryDialog_102002011":"Gu Qingfeng's eyes dim but turn normal when they look at you.",
"searchStoryDialog_102002012":"What are you talking about? Do you enjoy cold food?",
"searchStoryDialog_102002013":"No, no. Senior Brother won't let me eat a cold meal.",
"searchStoryDialog_102003001":"You wake up in the morning and find a new outfit by your bed. You don't need to guess because you know that Gu Qingfeng prepared that for you. The previous outfits are a little short, but the new outfit is just right.",
"searchStoryDialog_102003002":"You look for Gu Qingfeng in the studyroom with the new outfit. The door is open and he seems to be taking a nod-off because of tiredness.",
"searchStoryDialog_102003003":"Sneak in and scare him",
"searchStoryDialog_102003004":"You creep into the door and walks up to scare him.",
"searchStoryDialog_102003005":"What are you doing?",
"searchStoryDialog_102003006":"He is half-awake, lethargic yet sexy. Gu Qingfeng is not the kind that has a stunning appearance that will be remembered at a glance, but he will be loved for a long time.",
"searchStoryDialog_102003007":"Senior Brother, you know I'm here.",
"searchStoryDialog_102003008":"I woke up the moment you came into the yard. How's that? Does the outfit suit you?",
"searchStoryDialog_102003009":"Knock to remind him you're here.",
"searchStoryDialog_102003010":"When you knock on the door, he calls your name and lets you in.",
"searchStoryDialog_102003011":"You see that, Senior Brother? The new outfit suits me fine.",
"searchStoryDialog_102003012":"He is half-awake, lethargic yet sexy. Gu Qingfeng is not the kind that has a stunning appearance that will be remembered at a glance, but he will be loved for a long time.",
"searchStoryDialog_102003013":"Turn around and let me see.",
"searchStoryDialog_102003014":"You nod and turn around to show your new outfit. He pulls you over, straightens up the collar and cuffs. You've been accustomed to his care ever since you could remember.",
"searchStoryDialog_102004001":"One day, while you are walking with Gu Qingfeng. The cold weather gives you a sneeze. Gu Qingfeng takes off his coat and puts it on you.",
"searchStoryDialog_102004002":"(Moved) You are so kind, Senior Brother. But are you not feeling cold? You can't catch a cold.",
"searchStoryDialog_102004003":"I can have a rest at home if I do. But you can't.",
"searchStoryDialog_102004004":"He seems to have a point. You don't know how to answer him, but you faintly think you won't be happy if he's sick.",
"searchStoryDialog_102004005":"I won't feel good if you should fall ill.",
"searchStoryDialog_102004006":"He pets your head lovingly.",
"searchStoryDialog_102004007":"We both will not catch a cold. Let's return.",
"searchStoryDialog_102005001":"Today marks the Lantern Festival. You ask Gu Qingfeng to watch the fireworks on the roof. It's a bit cold up there. As you rub your hands, Gu Qingfeng opens his cloak and signals you in.",
"searchStoryDialog_102005002":"You smile as you crawl in. It is warm in the arms of Gu Qingfeng.",
"searchStoryDialog_102005003":"Brother, do you remember the Lantern Festival when I sneaked out and returned late? When I was gonna punished by my master and you kneel down to receive punishment on my behalf.",
"searchStoryDialog_102005004":"Yes. You enjoyed fun that year. I thought you were lost, and I was anxious and angry.",
"searchStoryDialog_102005005":"Then why receive the punishment for me?",
"searchStoryDialog_102005006":"I was not angry when I saw you were back.",
"searchStoryDialog_102005007":"You're not mad at me for anything, are you, Senior Brother?",
"searchStoryDialog_102005008":"As long as you are safe and happy.",
"searchStoryDialog_102005009":"(Act like a spoiled Child) Heehee, Senior Brother is the best.",
"searchStoryDialog_102005010":"You hug Gu Qingfeng and he rubs your head.",
"searchStoryDialog_102006001":"One day you return home, stained with dirt and bruised. Gu Qingfeng hurries over as he sees you and he helps you get changed and cleans the wounds for you.",
"searchStoryDialog_102006002":"(Rage) How did this happen?",
"searchStoryDialog_102006003":"(Excited) A criminal wanted to run when I escorted him... So, I ran after him.",
"searchStoryDialog_102006004":"(Snarls) And that's what you got? ！",
"searchStoryDialog_102006005":"(Proud) I was unhurt, and I hit him on the ground.",
"searchStoryDialog_102006006":"Gu Qingfeng ignores you but helps wrap up your wound.",
"searchStoryDialog_102006007":"You are a little flustered, tugging on his sleeve and coquettishly say that you are sorry. Finally, he sighs and looks up at you.",
"searchStoryDialog_102006008":"(Sighs) Don't do such a dangerous thing ever.",
"searchStoryDialog_102007001":"One day, a mid-aged woman pays a visit. You thought it is about business but it is about marriage proposal. And it is your Senior Brother Gu Qingfeng who will be matched.",
"searchStoryDialog_102007002":"The woman rambles long enough, which makes you feel somewhat awkward. Then Gu Qingfeng shows up and he's like a savior to you.",
"searchStoryDialog_102007003":"Senior Brother! The woman claims to be your matchmaker!",
"searchStoryDialog_102007004":"(Choke) Oh? What do you say, Your Excellency?",
"searchStoryDialog_102007005":"It'll be great if Senior Master has a wife to take care of him.",
"searchStoryDialog_102007006":"Gu Qingfeng's eyes dim. He looks at you with deep affection.",
"searchStoryDialog_102007007":"Somehow, at this moment, Gu Qingfeng seems to change into another person instead of the brother you grew up with.",
"searchStoryDialog_102007008":"If that's what you think, I'll follow your advice.",
"searchStoryDialog_102007009":"Gu Qingfeng turns back and returns to his room. The matchmaker is gratified. But you are not happy at all.",
"searchStoryDialog_102007010":"Marriage is mutual love. You can reject it if you don't love her.",
"searchStoryDialog_102007011":"(Smile) Yes, sure.",
"searchStoryDialog_102007012":"Gu Qingfeng sends the woman out. You can tell from his shadow that he's in a good mood.",
"searchStoryDialog_102008001":"You do not want to comb your own hair today, so you ask the servant to send for Gu Qingfeng. You sit in front of the mirror and he combs your hair with a wooden comb.",
"searchStoryDialog_102008002":"(Yawn) Senior Brother, I really can't go without you.",
"searchStoryDialog_102008003":"Then I will always be there for you.",
"searchStoryDialog_102008004":"That's not gonna happen?",
"searchStoryDialog_102008005":"Why?",
"searchStoryDialog_102008006":"If Senior Brother still dotes on me like this, my sister-in-law will be angry.",
"searchStoryDialog_102008007":"...",
"searchStoryDialog_102008008":"Gu Qingfeng does not answer. But you can not see his face in the mirror.",
"searchStoryDialog_102008009":"That'll be great.",
"searchStoryDialog_102008010":"Someone will brush my hair and cook for me every day...",
"searchStoryDialog_102008011":"Anyone around you can do these things.",
"searchStoryDialog_102008012":"No, I want Senior Brother!",
"searchStoryDialog_102008013":"Gu Qingfeng chuckles. Before long, you have a Beautiful bun on the head.",
"searchStoryDialog_102009001":"One day, a servant delivers a letter. It's for Gu Qingfeng. You are not sure who it is this time that wrote the love letter to Gu Qingfeng. It's not the first time to receive a letter like that. Gu Qingfeng burns the letter with the candle fire.",
"searchStoryDialog_102009002":"(Curious) Senior Brother, don't you wanna know if these girls are Beautiful or not?",
"searchStoryDialog_102009003":"No.",
"searchStoryDialog_102009004":"Why?",
"searchStoryDialog_102009005":"You really don't know why?",
"searchStoryDialog_102009006":"Gu Qingfeng put on grave eyes, as if he could read your inner thoughts. You are caught a bit flustered. You lower your head and fold the letters.",
"searchStoryDialog_102009007":"Was there me in your heart?",
"searchStoryDialog_102009008":"(Flustered) Of... Of course. Senior Brother matters!",
"searchStoryDialog_102009009":"(Frown) Simply a Senior Brother?",
"searchStoryDialog_102009010":"You dare not answer. You can guess what he wants to ask, but you do not know the answer to this question. Since young, you have become accustomed to his care. You need time to know your inner thoughts.",
"searchStoryDialog_102009011":"He sighs at the sight of you not saying a word. He torches your head as he always did and leaves.",
"searchStoryDialog_102010001":"You find these days somewhat awkward when you get along with Gu Qingfeng.",
"searchStoryDialog_102010002":"Although he still asks the kitchen to prepare your favorite food, take good care of you, you just feel something wrong.",
"searchStoryDialog_102010003":"You two remain silent over the dining table these days. Today, you want to break that silence...",
"searchStoryDialog_102010004":"Senior Brother...",
"searchStoryDialog_102010005":"Huh?",
"searchStoryDialog_102010006":"Are you... in a bad mood?",
"searchStoryDialog_102010007":"Nope. No talking over a meal. Just eat.",
"searchStoryDialog_102010008":"Gu Qingfeng puts on a grave look. You try to act like a girly girl as usual. He utters words before you take his corner of clothes.",
"searchStoryDialog_102010009":"Eat properly.",
"searchStoryDialog_102010010":"You feel aggrieved, but you have to sit back.",
"searchStoryDialog_102011001":"One day, a servant delivers a letter to Gu Qingfeng. Having read it, he gets changed and goes out.",
"searchStoryDialog_102011002":"You quietly sneak into the study and open the letter. The letters are Beautiful. It must be a girl who invited Gu Qingfeng to meet before the market at dusk.",
"searchStoryDialog_102011003":"Go to the market and find out",
"searchStoryDialog_102011004":"As soon as you arrive at the market, you see Gu Qingfeng talking to a Beautiful girl.",
"searchStoryDialog_102011005":"Gu Qingfeng looks in your direction. You are startled and fear that he might see you, so you leave.",
"searchStoryDialog_102011006":"As you walk a few steps away, several drops fall from your cheek. You look up and notice it's raining.",
"searchStoryDialog_102011007":"Stay home and wait for him",
"searchStoryDialog_102011008":"You feel it is not good to spy on people's privacy, so you stay at home and wait for him. It's getting dark and Gu Qingfeng finally comes back, with some girl's rogue.",
"searchStoryDialog_102011009":"Gu Qingfeng is surprised to see you waiting for him in the study. You feel unwell and leave without a word.",
"searchStoryDialog_102012001":"The past two months of Gu Qingfeng's indifference makes you suffer. One day, Gu Qingfeng comes for you. And you can't hold it back anymore.",
"searchStoryDialog_102012002":"(Drag corner of clothes) Please don't be like this, Senior Brother.",
"searchStoryDialog_102012003":"Gu Qingfeng is not indifferent to you like a few days ago, but he comes up to hold you. You don't break free but savor the familiar warmth in his chest.",
"searchStoryDialog_102012004":"It's my fault.",
"searchStoryDialog_102012005":"(Tighten the arm) I thought it over. Love me or not, I will make a pet of you like before.",
"searchStoryDialog_102012006":"(Lower his voice) I found that it hurts me the most when I force myself to ignore you.",
"searchStoryDialog_102012007":"I will put the feeling somewhere in the depths of my heart. I will protect you...",
"searchStoryDialog_102012008":"Senior Brother! I like you, too!",
"searchStoryDialog_102012009":"You hold him tight and you can feel him shaking.",
"searchStoryDialog_102012010":"These two months, I have also been thinking a lot. I don't want to lose you, nor do I want to do what you did to me. So... Senior Brother, will you stay with me forever like this/",
"searchStoryDialog_102012011":"Gu Qingfeng holds you with one hand, the other hand gently putting your head into his arms.",
"searchStoryDialog_102012012":"(Softly) As you say. As you say.",
"searchStoryDialog_102013001":"One day, when you go the market with Gu Qingfeng, a vendor is selling the sugar-coated haws. You would scurry to the vendor.",
"searchStoryDialog_102013002":"(Hold you) No.",
"searchStoryDialog_102013003":"(Groan coyly) Senior Brother...",
"searchStoryDialog_102013004":"Gu Qingfeng shakes his head. You look around, take him to an alley and kiss him quickly.",
"searchStoryDialog_102013005":"(Blushing and mouth-curling) Sugar-coated haws.",
"searchStoryDialog_102013006":"Gu Qingfeng is first frozen then bursts into laughter, touching your head.",
"searchStoryDialog_102013007":"One stick only.",
"searchStoryDialog_102013008":"(Jump) Hurray!",
"searchStoryDialog_102013009":"You walk out of the alley side by side. Covered by wide cuffs, your fingers hook together from time to time.",
"searchStoryDialog_102014001":"It's freezing today, and you're heating up by the firebox in the house. Gu Qingfeng comes in from outside with a blast of cold air and he shake off snowflakes.",
"searchStoryDialog_102014002":"His cheek is red with cold, his fingers stiff, and the cloak tied. You call him over to the fire, but he shakes his head, fearing he might give you the cold.",
"searchStoryDialog_102014003":"You crook head, put the fire pot and scurry over.",
"searchStoryDialog_102014004":"(Worried) Beware of catching cold.",
"searchStoryDialog_102014005":"(Mumble) You are to beware of cold.",
"searchStoryDialog_102014006":"He takes off the cloak, holding you in one hand and the torch in the other.",
"searchStoryDialog_102014007":"You hold him and do not let go. You quite enjoy it in his arms.",
"searchStoryDialog_102014008":"(Touch head) Good girl.",
"searchStoryDialog_102014009":"Do you like me, Senior Brother?",
"searchStoryDialog_102014010":"(Smile) Yes, I'm afraid I like you more than anyone else in this world.",
"searchStoryDialog_102015001":"March has growing grass and flying birds. So you ask Senior Brother Gu Qingfeng to fly kite suburb with you. But the kite is stuck in a tree by accident. You take off shoes and socks, climbing the tree.",
"searchStoryDialog_102015002":"(Worried) Slowly. Be careful.",
"searchStoryDialog_102015003":"(Unconcerned) Don't worry, I'll take the kite down.",
"searchStoryDialog_102015004":"Gu Qingfeng frowns at you under the tree, and you climb to the branch where the Kite hangs. When you reach out for the kite, you fall down with the kite due to imbalance.",
"searchStoryDialog_102015005":"(Anxious)! ！ ！",
"searchStoryDialog_102015006":"Gu Qingfeng hurriedly comes to help you sit up straight and does a careful examination. He doesn't rest assured until he confirms that it's a minor injury.",
"searchStoryDialog_102015007":"(Slightly reproachfully) It would be better to send for a doctor for a closer examination.",
"searchStoryDialog_102015008":"(Spit out tongue and look happy) I know, Senior Brother. Look, I got the kite!",
"searchStoryDialog_102015009":"Gu Qingfeng can only release a sigh when you laugh to your heart's content. He touches your head with his hand, eyes full of love.",
"searchStoryDialog_102016001":"You go to the study for Gu Qingfeng as usual one day, only to find that he isn't leaning against the window and reading as he always does. There is a letter on the chair.",
"searchStoryDialog_102016002":"The letter says that he was going to be away for about a month. You wrinkle the letter before your chest, feel somewhat painful.",
"searchStoryDialog_102016003":"You move the office site to the study. Then you fall asleep before the documents.",
"searchStoryDialog_102016004":"You sneeze when you wake up, remembering that Gu Qingfeng would put a coat on you and serve a cup of hot tea.",
"searchStoryDialog_102016005":"Senior Brother...",
"searchStoryDialog_102017001":"One day, you open the door of the study, noticing Gu Qingfeng sitting on the chair. He says nothing, which is unusual.",
"searchStoryDialog_102017002":"There are three invitations of the matchmaker on the table. You glance at Gu Qingfeng. He's staring at you.",
"searchStoryDialog_102017003":"(Nervously) Senior Brother...",
"searchStoryDialog_102017004":"(Contain anger) You proposed marriages for me?",
"searchStoryDialog_102017005":"(Afraid) I... I didn't...",
"searchStoryDialog_102017006":"(Harshly) If it weren't for your acquiescence, how dare they?",
"searchStoryDialog_102017007":"You step back. At the sight of having you scared, he calms down his tone.",
"searchStoryDialog_102017008":"(Sighs) Are you playing dumb or not?",
"searchStoryDialog_102017009":"He comes up to you, holding your hand onto his heart. When he speaks, you can feel him slightly trembling.",
"searchStoryDialog_102017010":"(Shiver) You really don't know, since ten years ago, that there has already lived a man here?",
"searchStoryDialog_202001001":"One day when it's freaking cold. You return from outside. You stomp your feet, dropping the snow.",
"searchStoryDialog_202001002":"Feng Xiaolian comes out from the inner room. You look at her, her eyes full of care and love.",
"searchStoryDialog_202001003":"(Distressed) Your Excellency, are you feeling cold. Come on in.",
"searchStoryDialog_202001004":"She trots over, greeting you with a pair of soft hands and a refreshing fragrance.",
"searchStoryDialog_202001005":"(Pitifully) Xiaolian, why come out. Go inside quick.",
"searchStoryDialog_202001006":"(Shy) His Excellency toils away outside. How can I enjoy myself inside. I've prepared charcoal and hot soup.",
"searchStoryDialog_202001007":"You are so nice, Xiaolian. I don't feel cold to the slightest.",
"searchStoryDialog_202001008":"You enter the inner room with Xiaolian, warming up by the fire pot. Her eyes are full of love.",
"searchStoryDialog_103001001":"One day, you meet this snowy white puppy near Yong's Mansion. It runs and stops, as if having separated from its owner. Now that the business in the mansion has been done, you stop to play with the puppy.",
"searchStoryDialog_103001002":"The puppy doesn't take you as a stranger. It protrudes tough and shakes tail as you wave, looking happy.",
"searchStoryDialog_103001003":"(Panting) Xiao... Xiaobai, here you are! I'm so anxious!",
"searchStoryDialog_103001004":"A yellow-haired boy runs to you. The dog gives two barks. It should probably know the boy.",
"searchStoryDialog_103001005":"The boy bents and carries the puppy in his chest who looks quite intimate by waving its tail. He straightens up his collar and prostrate before you.",
"searchStoryDialog_103001006":"Sorry that Xiaobai has put you out, Your Excellency. I'm Tang Siji. How may I address you?",
"searchStoryDialog_103001007":"Xiaobai is really a casual nickname.",
"searchStoryDialog_103001008":"It's so called usually. It has another name, Guard.",
"searchStoryDialog_103001009":"Guard means Tiger for an animal. It will be a great pet when it grows up.",
"searchStoryDialog_103001010":"The puppy barks as if it could understand you. And the boy laughs.",
"searchStoryDialog_103001011":"(Happy) I'd love to extend thanks to Your Excellency on behalf of Xiaobai.",
"searchStoryDialog_103001012":"You chat with the boy for a while, and suddenly you realize that you have been near Yong's Mansion for too long. Fearing there might be rumors, you bid farewell to the boy.",
"searchStoryDialog_103002001":"You hear the barks when you enter Yong's Mansion one day. Xiaobai runs all the way to you. You look in that direction, noticing Tang Siji is behind.",
"searchStoryDialog_103002002":"(Scoop) (Excuse me) It's you, Your Excellency. Xiaobai seems to have sensed something and runs by itself. Turns out it's you coming.",
"searchStoryDialog_103002003":"You touch the head of the puppy and the puppy gently rubs your hand.",
"searchStoryDialog_103002004":"Weird though, seldom has Xiaobai been intimate to a stranger. Seems it likes you very much.",
"searchStoryDialog_103002005":"(Shake the puppy's paws) I like you, too.",
"searchStoryDialog_103002006":"(Catch sight of the document in your hand) Your Excellency, is there any business? I'm sorry for any holdup.",
"searchStoryDialog_103002007":"You like it that Tang Siji has a good observation. He leaves as he cups his hands.",
"searchStoryDialog_103003001":"You come out from the study of Yong's Mansion. And Tang Siji is standing in the pavilion outside the study with Xiaobai in his chest. He greets you happily as you come out.",
"searchStoryDialog_103003002":"(Jump) Your Excellency, here!",
"searchStoryDialog_103003003":"You walk towards the pavilion, and the servant next to Tang Siji takes out a few plates of delicate southern pastries from the basket and places them on the table, next to a pot of tea. You sniff and find it's your favorite Jasmine Maojian.",
"searchStoryDialog_103003004":"I didn't thank you well when Your Excellency found Xiaobai for me. Heard that you come from the southern China, so I ordered my servants to prepare the local pastries in return.",
"searchStoryDialog_103003005":"You admire his considerateness from your bottom of heart. You invite him to sit down and enjoy the pastries with you.",
"searchStoryDialog_103003006":"The boy speaks in a fine and pleasing manner and with the energy and vigor unique to youth. You are more curious who he is in the Mansion.",
"searchStoryDialog_103003007":"I heard Your Excellency is uncorrupted and obliged to seek public interest. I've been living in the mansion and longing for the ordinary life outside the high walls.",
"searchStoryDialog_103003008":"(Careful) I wonder if Your Excellency can take me out for a walk if that doesn't trouble you much. You can forget it if you are too busy with the political affairs.",
"searchStoryDialog_103003009":"You promise him as you are moved by his kindness. Tang Siji goes into raptures when you promise him. The puppy barks and circles you.",
"searchStoryDialog_103004001":"Thinking of the promise to take Tang Siji out for a walk, you ask a servant to request before Yong's Mansion. Tang Siji soon arrives at your mansion. His face is overwhelmed with joy.",
"searchStoryDialog_103004002":"You hang around the market and he's curious about everything and all.",
"searchStoryDialog_103004003":"(Cheerful) Mother would never let me go out alone before, but this time I'm finally free.",
"searchStoryDialog_103004004":"I won't even get a chance to go out with you if my cousin didn't talk some senses into mother.",
"searchStoryDialog_103004005":"He looked at you with a puzzled look and starts to explain it to you.",
"searchStoryDialog_103004006":"Now with Lord Yong being Siji's uncle, mother has become Lord Yong's sister and my cousin, Xiao Yixing, has become the eldest son.",
"searchStoryDialog_103004007":"Now you know the reason why he is able to walk freely inside Yong's Mansion.",
"searchStoryDialog_103005001":"After you promised Tang Siji that you would often take him out with you, he started sending his servant to deliver words to you every once in a while. You know he'd love to go out with you, but you've been in business lately, so you send your servant to invite him to your mansion.",
"searchStoryDialog_103005002":"(Shrugs) Mr. Tang, my apologies, I couldn't take you outside because of my overwhelming public business.",
"searchStoryDialog_103005003":"(Excited) Please call me Siji. Being inside your mansion is all I've ever wanted.",
"searchStoryDialog_103005004":"Siji seems to be interested in the garden of your mansion, you decide leave him roam freely.",
"searchStoryDialog_103005005":"As you're working with the documents, he keeps exploring your mansion. When you stand up, he attends to your side, like a puppet to a master.",
"searchStoryDialog_103005006":"You feel awkward when he does that, but you couldn't tell him because of his shiny eyes filled with expectation.",
"searchStoryDialog_103006001":"As you arrive in the wilderness where Tang Siji has invited you to, you found him with two horses.",
"searchStoryDialog_103006002":"(Excited) This one's name is Wu Zhui, he is an obedient yet fast one. This one is Xiang Yun, slightly slower, but royal. Which one would you like to ride, my lord?",
"searchStoryDialog_103006003":"(Hesitating) ... I'm not really good at riding a horse.",
"searchStoryDialog_103006004":"(Happy) Worry not, my lord, I'll teach you! It feels good to run in the wilderness!",
"searchStoryDialog_103006005":"You gave up the idea of giving up riding when you see Tang Siji, who is all fired up and ready to give you a ride。 Tang Siji flips on Wu Zhui as Xiang Yun walks by it.",
"searchStoryDialog_103006006":"Tang Siji reaches out to you.",
"searchStoryDialog_103006007":"[Sit in front of him]",
"searchStoryDialog_103006008":"You sit in front of him, with his hands around your waist.",
"searchStoryDialog_103006009":"I just found out that you're slimmer than me, my lord. You should consider resting a bit more.",
"searchStoryDialog_103006010":"(Panic) Ahem, yeah... definitely. I was born with a weak body.",
"searchStoryDialog_103006011":"I'm sorry to hear that, my lord. Come, my lord, hold the reins, I'll teach you how to ride.",
"searchStoryDialog_103006012":"As you grasp the reins, Tang Siji's holds your hand. He shakes the reins with your hands and Wu Zhui starts to run cheerfully.",
"searchStoryDialog_103006013":"The wind kisses your cheek, your heart starts to beat rapidly. It is not the horse that grasped your heart, but the man behind you.",
"searchStoryDialog_103006014":"[Sit behind him]",
"searchStoryDialog_103006015":"You sit behind him and hold him firmly by the waist for the fear of falling off.",
"searchStoryDialog_103006016":"Be at ease, my lord, I won't let you fall.",
"searchStoryDialog_103006017":"Tang Siji shakes the reins gently and Wu Zhui starts to walk slowly. Although Tang Sixuan is still a teenager, his shoulder is wide enough for you to rest upon. You feel at ease when you hold him, thinking that he could be a reliable person.",
"searchStoryDialog_103006018":"After a few steps, Tang Siji unmounts and walks slowly with the reins in his hands. He teaches you to ride as both of you roam freely in the wilderness. He rides you home when the sunset finally comes.",
"searchStoryDialog_103007001":"Your feelings for Tang Siji has changed, to which you can't understand... yet.",
"searchStoryDialog_103007002":"Today, you are walking in the market with Tang Siji. Your heart feels a discomfort when the girls on the street are looking at Tang Siji.",
"searchStoryDialog_103007003":"(Nervous) Siji, let's return.",
"searchStoryDialog_103007004":"(Puzzled) But we just came out.",
"searchStoryDialog_103007005":"Tang Siji thinks about the matter for a second, then shows a sad face.",
"searchStoryDialog_103007006":"(Aggrieved) My lord, am I stopping you to talk to the girls? So you feel bored going out with me?",
"searchStoryDialog_103007007":"Of course not...",
"searchStoryDialog_103007008":"You can't think of a good answer yet, the words are on the tip of your mouth but you just can't say anything.",
"searchStoryDialog_103007009":"Or do you feel uncomfortable when the girls are all staring at you?",
"searchStoryDialog_103007010":"(Smile) Don't care too much about them, my lord. We're free to choose what WE do, do you agree with me?",
"searchStoryDialog_103007011":"His smile melts your heart and you always know that he really likes to go out with you.",
"searchStoryDialog_103007012":"And more importantly, he has no intention to talk to other girls. Knowing this, you let out a heavy breath and relieved.",
"searchStoryDialog_103007013":"(Happy) Hey Siji, why don't we get some food? I'm treating!",
"searchStoryDialog_103008001":"As of recent, you and Tang Siji went out a lot, making his mother quite unhappy, so she decides to have Tang Siji accompany her for a few days. He keeps sending letter to you everyday when he is not around.",
"searchStoryDialog_103008002":"[My lord, Siji and mother went to a mountain villa, it's a great place and I would like to go there with you next time.]",
"searchStoryDialog_103008003":"[Today, the chief made us a crystal lotus cake, I would like you to take a bite next time, my lord.]",
"searchStoryDialog_103008004":"[My lord, please take care when I am away. I will be coming back in just a few days.]",
"searchStoryDialog_103008005":"[My lord, may I get a reply from you? You can give the letter to my servant, he will be my courier.]",
"searchStoryDialog_103008006":"You put the letters that Tang Siji wrote to you on the table, feeling hard to breath because of the weights of his words.",
"searchStoryDialog_103008007":"You smiles and write down a sentence.",
"searchStoryDialog_103008008":"[Everything is well, miss you.]",
"searchStoryDialog_103009001":"Tang Siji doesn't seem happy recently.",
"searchStoryDialog_103009002":"Are you okay?",
"searchStoryDialog_103009003":"(Frustrated) Mother will be going back to Jiangnan soon, me too.",
"searchStoryDialog_103009004":"Tang Siji is leaving, this is a hard message to take. Seeing your face, Tang Siji let out a laugh.",
"searchStoryDialog_103009005":"I was right, my lord. You don't want me to leave too, do you? The sheer thought of not being able to meet you pains my heart, my lord, to the point that I have to see you to get relief.",
"searchStoryDialog_103009006":"And as soon as I see you, the pain is gone.",
"searchStoryDialog_103009007":"His wholeheartedly words penetrates your heart, making your face blushing like flame.",
"searchStoryDialog_103009008":"What's going on, my lord?! Are you not well?",
"searchStoryDialog_103009009":"(Nervous) No, no, I'm fine, really...",
"searchStoryDialog_103009010":"He touches your forehead and holds your hand immediately.",
"searchStoryDialog_103009011":"(Worried) My lord, please lie down, you're having a fever.",
"searchStoryDialog_103009012":"You are dizzied by what his words, your heartbeat is fast and you can't seem to move. You know, that you want him to take care of you for the rest of your life.",
"searchStoryDialog_103010001":"Tang Siji is teaching how to ride again, suddenly, you would like to ask him a question.",
"searchStoryDialog_103010002":"Siji, why are to being so nice to me?",
"searchStoryDialog_103010003":"Because I like you, my lord.",
"searchStoryDialog_103010004":"That is the reason.",
"searchStoryDialog_103010005":"(Head Tilts) Strangely enough, I never wanted to be nice to anyone, except you, my lord.",
"searchStoryDialog_103010006":"Tang Siji's is a simple and honest person, his words are like a gently breeze that peels through the veil of your heart. You're blushing at what he says, you quickly change the topic.",
"searchStoryDialog_103011001":"Ever since being [confessed] by Tang Siji, you starts to fancy his company more and more. Today, he invites you to Zuixian Tavern to taste the famous dish— The Squirrel Cinnamon.",
"searchStoryDialog_103011002":"(Eager) The chief is famous for his Squirrel Cinnamon, you have to try it, my lord!",
"searchStoryDialog_103011003":"You haven't eaten the food of home for a long time, you put the delicious meat into your mouth, what a heavenly taste! It's just that...",
"searchStoryDialog_103011004":"Cough cough cough cough! !!",
"searchStoryDialog_103011005":"(Tensed) My lord! What's wrong! Are you stuck?",
"searchStoryDialog_103011006":"Tang Siji stands up and starts to pad your back, followed by delivering a cup of hot tea to you. After a few cups of tea, the fish stab is finally washed down.",
"searchStoryDialog_103011007":"Tang Siji relieved, he asked for a clean dish, put some meat in it and started to clean up the stabs inside.",
"searchStoryDialog_103011008":"My lord, I'll clean up the stabs for you, please wait for a minute.",
"searchStoryDialog_103011009":"The fish in the small dish gradually piled into a hill, you crooked your head to look at Tang Siji, who have warmed your heart.",
"searchStoryDialog_103012001":"You started to feel that maybe Tang Siji is too good for you, considering your true identity. After thinking for a few nights, you finally decided to confess to Tang Siji.",
"searchStoryDialog_103012002":"(Heavy) Tang Siji, there is something I need to tell you.",
"searchStoryDialog_103012003":"Knowing that you rarely call him with his last name, Tang Siji sat straight and started to get nervous.",
"searchStoryDialog_103012004":"Well... Actually... I am a woman.",
"searchStoryDialog_103012005":"Your words shocked Tang Siji. Seeing him like this, you start to feel even more guilty.",
"searchStoryDialog_103012006":"I am sorry, Siji. I didn't mean to hide from you, I have my reasons.",
"searchStoryDialog_103012007":"(Excited) That's great!",
"searchStoryDialog_103012008":"He suddenly got excited, and his face was full of excitement.",
"searchStoryDialog_103012009":"(Excited) I read a lot of books and I know that maybe I was interested in men, I never thought you'd be a girl.",
"searchStoryDialog_103012010":"You don't blame me for lying to you?",
"searchStoryDialog_103012011":"Never! Siji likes you, my lord, then gender doesn't matter!",
"searchStoryDialog_103012012":"Tang Siji's eyes are full of sincerity and love. You finally relieved yourself.",
"searchStoryDialog_103013001":"Today, Tang Siji has invited to the woods in the outskirts.",
"searchStoryDialog_103013002":"(Wonder) Siji, why are we here?",
"searchStoryDialog_103013003":"I know you would prefer somewhere quiet for a date, my lord.",
"searchStoryDialog_103013004":"Tang Siji stood in front of you with open arms, smiling at you.",
"searchStoryDialog_103013005":"Will you embrace me, my lord?",
"searchStoryDialog_103013006":"Your heartbeat raised, after making sure there is no one around, you finally embraced Tang Siji.",
"searchStoryDialog_103013007":"Tang Siji holds you in his arms, like he was holding the most precious treasure in the world.",
"searchStoryDialog_103013008":"(Pretends to be mature) Worries not, my lord, Siji will protect you forever.",
"searchStoryDialog_103014001":"You're working with the documents in your study, suddenly, you saw a mouse ran through.",
"searchStoryDialog_103014002":"(Frightened) Ahhhh!",
"searchStoryDialog_103014003":"Hearing your screaming, Tang Siji rushed to your side and guarded in front of you.",
"searchStoryDialog_103014004":"(Nervous) What's going on! My lord! Siji is here for you!",
"searchStoryDialog_103014005":"(Scared) Th... there was a mouse running.",
"searchStoryDialog_103014006":"You held the hand of Tang Siji tightly and wouldn't let go, Tang Siji responded by doing the same.",
"searchStoryDialog_103014007":"You pretended to calmly revise the documents as Tang Siji had his servant to catch the mouse, your holding hands were hidden under the table.",
"searchStoryDialog_103014008":"Put the mouse in the cage and send it back to Yong's Mansion.",
"searchStoryDialog_103014009":"The servant didn't understand the meaning of this task, but fulfilled it anyway. After the servant left, you turned to look at Tang Siji.",
"searchStoryDialog_103014010":"(Confused) Siji, why?",
"searchStoryDialog_103014011":"Tang Siji raised your clenched hands with joy.",
"searchStoryDialog_103014012":"(Pleasure) This is the first time you hold my hand actively, the mouse, as a matchmaker, deserve a good treat!",
"searchStoryDialog_103015001":"Tang Siji has not come to you for several days and you are busy dealing with a flood problem too. After you finally solved the problem, half a month has already past.",
"searchStoryDialog_103015002":"Just as you set out for Yong's Mansion with a brand new clothing, you found Tang Siji waiting in the courtyard already. After you told your servant to leave, Tang Siji rushed to give you a hug.",
"searchStoryDialog_103015003":"(Delighted) My lord, I don't have to leave now!",
"searchStoryDialog_103015004":"Ever since he last said he was going back to Jiangnan with his mother, you've been troubled by it. Your heart is overflowing with joy, but you have to know the whys.",
"searchStoryDialog_103015005":"Siji has spent a lot of time convincing mother to let me stay and my cousin just happened to have a few banks that need to be taken care of, so he is the one that really convinced mother.",
"searchStoryDialog_103015006":"I'm glad mother has agreed.",
"searchStoryDialog_103015007":"(Expectation) My lord, are you happy?",
"searchStoryDialog_103015008":"Siji is really like a cute puppet at this moment, you thought to yourself.",
"searchStoryDialog_103015009":"You nod, and Siji holds you up, spinning around like a merry-go-around. The delightful act makes you dizzy, but you are happy with it.",
"searchStoryDialog_103015010":"My lord, may I ask for a little reward?",
"searchStoryDialog_103015011":"Which is?",
"searchStoryDialog_103015012":"A kiss!",
"searchStoryDialog_103015013":"You smiled and kissed him on the cheek, and he shook his head and tapped his lips.",
"searchStoryDialog_103015014":"(Laugh) Try here!",
"searchStoryDialog_103016001":"Today, Tang Siji drags you into the room, closed the door, and started to loose his cloth.",
"searchStoryDialog_103016002":"(Nervous) Wh...what are you doing?",
"searchStoryDialog_103016003":"After some hard effort, Tang Siji pulled out a jade pendant.",
"searchStoryDialog_103016004":"I was wearing this pendant ever since I can remember things, mother said it can keep me safe.",
"searchStoryDialog_103016005":"Tang Siji entrusted the pendant to you by putting it on your neck. Your feel his warmth as if it's going to merge into your soul.",
"searchStoryDialog_103016006":"(Hesitated) Your mother gave you this, I can't have it.",
"searchStoryDialog_103016007":"You tried to return the pendant, but he stopped your hand.",
"searchStoryDialog_103016008":"(Serious) I care about your safety more than mine, my lord.",
"searchStoryDialog_103016009":"Keep it, I want you to be safe and happy.",
"searchStoryDialog_103016010":"(Mischievous) Please keep your eyes on me and only me for today and the days that are yet to come, my lord!",
"searchStoryDialog_103017001":"As you're enjoying the night, someone rushes to you mounting a horse. With shock, you fell down on the ground.",
"searchStoryDialog_103017002":"(Nervous) Are you all right?",
"searchStoryDialog_103017003":"A teenager in a goose-yellow robe is looking at you nervously and worriedly. He reached out to pull you up, but he didn't expect to be pounced on by you.",
"searchStoryDialog_103017004":"The fragrance on his robe makes you relaxed. You said it was all right and retreated from his arms. He looked apologetic and didn't know what to do.",
"searchStoryDialog_103017005":"(Concerned) Please seek me out in [Yong's Mansion] should you feel hurt.",
"searchStoryDialog_203001001":"As you're walking around in the garden of Yong's Mansion, you see Xiao Cui cleaning. You head over and give her a pad.",
"searchStoryDialog_203001002":"Ah! (Relaxed) Oh! My lord, I'm sorry.",
"searchStoryDialog_203001003":"(Aggrieved) I miss you so much.",
"searchStoryDialog_203001004":"You pretend to be aggrieved, Xiao Cui hints you to follow her. After quite a journey, the two of you arrived behind a rockery.",
"searchStoryDialog_203001005":"(Whisper) It was the old lord's birthday a few days ago, the whole mansion was busy.",
"searchStoryDialog_203001006":"Does that mean it's more important than me?",
"searchStoryDialog_203001007":"(Shy and annoyed) My lord! I'm going if you say that again.",
"searchStoryDialog_203001008":"You put Xiao Cui into your arms, she pretended to push you away for a few times before finally hugged back.",
"searchStoryDialog_203001009":"I miss you, Cui.",
"searchStoryDialog_203001010":"(Shy) Me... me too, my lord.",
"searchStoryDialog_104001001":"Today, the number one dancer of Misty Brothel will be performing a show.",
"searchStoryDialog_104001002":"Lord Li has arranged two good seats in the front already.",
"searchStoryDialog_104001003":"You're not interested in the dancer and starts to look at the guests around you.",
"searchStoryDialog_104001004":"You see a man in dark clothing sitting there, who doesn't seem to belong here.",
"searchStoryDialog_104001005":"A waiter asked him if he needs some snacks, he refused the offer.",
"searchStoryDialog_104001006":"No, thank you.",
"searchStoryDialog_104001007":"His voice is melody to your ears and his handsome face interests you too.",
"searchStoryDialog_104001008":"The man seems to notice that you're staring at him.",
"searchStoryDialog_104001009":"……",
"searchStoryDialog_104001010":"When the two of you cross sight, you feel the cold inside of him, it was not a pleasure experience.",
"searchStoryDialog_104001011":"……",
"searchStoryDialog_104001012":"The dancer has finally showed up, you turned your sight to the stage too.",
"searchStoryDialog_104001013":"Though, your mind pays no attention to the dance, you're thinking about the man and you can't stop yourself to give him a few more looks.",
"searchStoryDialog_104002001":"You can't seem to forget the strange man ever since the night you've crossed sights. Today, you came to Misty Brothel alone, wishing to see the man again.",
"searchStoryDialog_104002002":"To your disappointment, he wasn't there today, and you sat down, had a cup of tea, only to see the man walk in through the door.",
"searchStoryDialog_104002003":"You were shocked and happy, and couldn't help staring at him all the time. He was going to the corner seat, but when he found you staring at him, he came towards you.",
"searchStoryDialog_104002004":"(Apathy) Looking for me?",
"searchStoryDialog_104002005":"You swayed, the man put his sword on the table and sat next to you, his eyes are as cold as a frozen river.",
"searchStoryDialog_104002006":"Ah... not really...",
"searchStoryDialog_104002007":"The man picked his eyebrows, picked up the sword, ready to leave. You hurried to hold him.",
"searchStoryDialog_104002008":"Ah... I mean, I just want to see you again ever since last time we have... met.",
"searchStoryDialog_104002009":"He looked at your hand as if he was recalling something. Suddenly, a dove whistle is blown, the man shake off your hand and goes straight to the doorway.",
"searchStoryDialog_104002010":"It's...",
"searchStoryDialog_104002011":"What is it?",
"searchStoryDialog_104002012":"Well... nothing really, I just want to see you again, you know, out of my curiosity.",
"searchStoryDialog_104002013":"……",
"searchStoryDialog_104002014":"The man seemed to hear something strange and frowned at you. Hearing a dove whistle, the man picked up the sword and wanted to leave.",
"searchStoryDialog_104002015":"Hey, you're leaving? I don't know your name yet!",
"searchStoryDialog_104002016":"The man did not answer, he exited the door and disappeared into the crowd.",
"searchStoryDialog_104003001":"You couldn't even remember how many times you've come to Misty Brothel. The man wasn't there for the last few times when you visit the brothel, but you're stubborn enough to keep trying.",
"searchStoryDialog_104003002":"Seeing a familiar face, the waiter poured some tea for you without saying a word.",
"searchStoryDialog_104003003":"Suddenly, a sword was placed on your table, you turned around and found the man there.",
"searchStoryDialog_104003004":"You've come!",
"searchStoryDialog_104003005":"The man moves his eyebrows, he is trying to ask if you were waiting for him this time.",
"searchStoryDialog_104003006":"(Happy) Yes! Yes! I'm waiting for you!",
"searchStoryDialog_104003007":"What do you want from me?",
"searchStoryDialog_104003008":"Well, it's nothing. Somehow I just want to see you again.",
"searchStoryDialog_104003009":"The man wanted to say something, but something caught his eyes, you look around not knowing who he was talking to.",
"searchStoryDialog_104003010":"You should return for the day.",
"searchStoryDialog_104003011":"You wanted to stop him but was stopped by him first.",
"searchStoryDialog_104003012":"Three days later, wait for me here.",
"searchStoryDialog_104003013":"He turned away and left after giving you this promise.",
"searchStoryDialog_104004001":"You came to Misty Brothel and found the man had been waiting for you for a long time. You walked up to the seat next to him and sat down.",
"searchStoryDialog_104004002":"He took a delicate short whistle out and handed it to you.",
"searchStoryDialog_104004003":"(Confused) What's this?",
"searchStoryDialog_104004004":"If you want to find me, blow this whistle in the woods outside the city.",
"searchStoryDialog_104004005":"But why did you give it to me?",
"searchStoryDialog_104004006":"He looked at you, this time with a slighter warmer sight.",
"searchStoryDialog_104004007":"...... I'm just being curious too. So you want it or not?",
"searchStoryDialog_104004008":"Yes! Yes please!",
"searchStoryDialog_104004009":"You rushed to get the whistle into your pocket.",
"searchStoryDialog_104004010":"(Cautiously) Well... May I have your name?",
"searchStoryDialog_104004011":"...... Bei Ran",
"searchStoryDialog_104005001":"You blow the whistle in the woods, waiting for the man to show up. A moment later, Bei Ran showed up standing in a tree not afar. He took a leap and landed firmly in front of you.",
"searchStoryDialog_104005002":"(Apathy) Why did you call me?",
"searchStoryDialog_104005003":"Ah... I just wanna try if this whistle really works...",
"searchStoryDialog_104005004":"You think I'm lying to you?",
"searchStoryDialog_104005005":"(Nervous) No! I, I also want to see you...",
"searchStoryDialog_104005006":"After a moment of silence, Bei Ran started to talk.",
"searchStoryDialog_104005007":"Now that you're here, let's take a walk.",
"searchStoryDialog_104005008":"Bei Ran started to walk quickly and you tried to catch up with him.",
"searchStoryDialog_104005009":"Although the silence remained, you don't feel it's awkward at all, because walking with Bei Ran feels pleasant.",
"searchStoryDialog_104006001":"Today you're hanging out in the market, you see a familiar face standing in front of a trinket shop, you walk up and stand next to him.",
"searchStoryDialog_104006002":"Hey, you wanna one for your girl? Can't believe you're into trinkets.",
"searchStoryDialog_104006003":"Bei Ran gave you a glance, staying silent. Feeling awkward, you picked and wore up a silver rabbit hairpin.",
"searchStoryDialog_104006004":"So how do I look?",
"searchStoryDialog_104006005":"(Stunned) ...",
"searchStoryDialog_104006006":"You've never seen Bei Ran like this, as if he saw someone else through you. But it was only in the blink of an eye that he recovered as usual.",
"searchStoryDialog_104006007":"You took off your hairpin and expected some silence as usual. Out of your surprise, Bei Ran started to talk first.",
"searchStoryDialog_104006008":"...... Beautiful.",
"searchStoryDialog_104006009":"You couldn't believe what you've just heard until Bei Ran gave you another glance.",
"searchStoryDialog_104007001":"Today, just when you want to blow the whistle, Bei Ran landed right in front of you.",
"searchStoryDialog_104007002":"Did you call me?",
"searchStoryDialog_104007003":"(Feeling down) Yes... Been busy for a while now, the woods is the only place that makes me feel relaxing.",
"searchStoryDialog_104007004":"You shouldn't work so hard, you know, as a female.",
"searchStoryDialog_104007005":"(Frightened) You... how did you know?",
"searchStoryDialog_104007006":"Bei Ran doesn't seem to express any emotion as if he knows it from the very beginning.",
"searchStoryDialog_104007007":"Yes, from the first glance, I knew you are a female.",
"searchStoryDialog_104007008":"Then why didn't you tell me?",
"searchStoryDialog_104007009":"(Frown) Why should I?",
"searchStoryDialog_104007010":"There are some secrets in our lives that cannot be exposed, because when they do, someone is going to suffer for it.",
"searchStoryDialog_104007011":"You were frightened by his words, but he didn't care.",
"searchStoryDialog_104007012":"But when I want someone alive, no one can hurt her.",
"searchStoryDialog_104007013":"When he said this, he looked at you firmly, with your figure in his eyes. His sight is sharp, but also sweet and warm.",
"searchStoryDialog_104008001":"A few days ago, you led many soldiers to deal with the bandits, only to found that the bandits in the den were already immobilized.",
"searchStoryDialog_104008002":"You had the officers bring back the bandits to jail, wondering who did all these? The town folks were all talking about you, praising your might and courage.",
"searchStoryDialog_104008003":"With a heavy heart, you went to the woods and called Bei Ran with the whistle.",
"searchStoryDialog_104008004":"The bandits have been dealt with, why the long face?",
"searchStoryDialog_104008005":"You're right, but I didn't do it... who could... wait, was it you?",
"searchStoryDialog_104008006":"He doesn't make a sound, but you know that's the answer.",
"searchStoryDialog_104008007":"(Depressed) I'm sorry that I put you in danger.",
"searchStoryDialog_104008008":"(Glancing at you) I was safe, you don't have to apologize. I haven't seen an officer like you before.",
"searchStoryDialog_104008009":"Now I owe you a favor...",
"searchStoryDialog_104008010":"And you don't like it? I wouldn't give it away normally.",
"searchStoryDialog_104008011":"You were rendered speechless, tearing the leaves in your hands into pieces, but what you didn't see is a smiling Bei Ran standing behind you.",
"searchStoryDialog_104009001":"The night is young, while you're revising the documents, you heard the sound of the tiles over your head, you thought it was just a naughty cat's doing. Suddenly, the window is opened and a shadow shrouded by moonlight flips in, you threw your pen away out of the shock.",
"searchStoryDialog_104009002":"(Frightened) Who goes there! How dare you trespassing the mansion of an imperial official! It will be a death sentence according to the law!",
"searchStoryDialog_104009003":"The shadow smiled disdainfully and started to walk towards you. You are too afraid to move, and when the man approached, you saw his face by candlelight, it's Bei Ran.",
"searchStoryDialog_104009004":"Oh thank goodness, it's you.",
"searchStoryDialog_104009005":"Why did you panic?",
"searchStoryDialog_104009006":"I'm not like you, who can deal with trespassers single-handed.",
"searchStoryDialog_104009007":"Though, why are you here?",
"searchStoryDialog_104009008":"Just drop by to check you out.",
"searchStoryDialog_104009009":"Is it because that I haven't been looking for you lately?",
"searchStoryDialog_104009010":"You know he won't answer your question, so you pointed your finger to the pile of documents that you had to revise.",
"searchStoryDialog_104009011":"Recently, Windy Hill was occupied by a group of bandits who had laid down a den there. The hill connects a lot of businesses, it is an important place. The letters were written by our people, asking us to drive away those bandits.",
"searchStoryDialog_104009012":"You kept rambling about your affairs while Bei Ran leaned to a pillar behind you and responded [uhhuh] to you every once in a while.",
"searchStoryDialog_104009013":"At dawn, you found yourself waking up from your bed and Bei Ran is nowhere to be seen.",
"searchStoryDialog_104010001":"You went to the woods again to seek out Bei Ran today.",
"searchStoryDialog_104010002":"(Curious) Did you annoy you by summoning you out so frequently?",
"searchStoryDialog_104010003":"If I said yes, you won't come again?",
"searchStoryDialog_104010004":"Yes I will.",
"searchStoryDialog_104010005":"Knowing the silliness of your own question, you decided to remain silent and started to take a walk with Bei Ran.",
"searchStoryDialog_104010006":"Suddenly, he stopped and hinted you to go behind him. You hide behind him and took a peak to see what's happening, but the woods stayed quiet as usual.",
"searchStoryDialog_104010007":"He held your hand, turned around and was ready to leave. You asked why.",
"searchStoryDialog_104010008":"Recently someone is trying to meet up with a spy in this woods. The culprit is a powerful man, he was always protected by a few seasoned bodyguards.",
"searchStoryDialog_104010009":"I suggest you to stay away from this woods for a few days.",
"searchStoryDialog_104011001":"Today is just like any other day, you went to the woods to meet Bei Ran.",
"searchStoryDialog_104011002":"After some time, you heard some heavy footsteps looming in— it's definitely not Bei Ran.",
"searchStoryDialog_104011003":"You took a step back out of panic, hitting someone with a warm chest.",
"searchStoryDialog_104011004":"Hush.",
"searchStoryDialog_104011005":"It was Bei Ran. He picked you up and you held his neck.",
"searchStoryDialog_104011006":"What are you doing?",
"searchStoryDialog_104011007":"(Calm) We are leaving.",
"searchStoryDialog_104011008":"He rushes through the woods with you in his arms. The wind cuts by your face with some abnormal sounds, you knew it's the chasers. He put you down and told you to stay put.",
"searchStoryDialog_104011009":"For a while, all you could hear was the clashing of cold metals. You wanted to see Bei Ran but you were afraid of getting in his way. Finally, the battle was over, Bei Ran returned to you with blood on his body.",
"searchStoryDialog_104011010":"(Nervous) Are you hurt? Where's the injury? Is it painful?",
"searchStoryDialog_104011011":"...... Are you worried about me?",
"searchStoryDialog_104011012":"(A little angry) Yes! Of course! You're bleeding! How come I not be worried! You dumb wood! Now show me the wounds!",
"searchStoryDialog_104011013":"He looked at you busy finding a wound and let out a laugh. Just as you were about to get angry, he embraced you into his arms.",
"searchStoryDialog_104011014":"(With a soft voice) It's been a long time since somebody talks to me like this. Don't worry, these aren't my blood.",
"searchStoryDialog_104012001":"By the time he confirmed that the chasers won't be bothering you again, it was already at sunset. It would be dangerous to walk back to city now, so the two of you decided to camp in the woods for the night.",
"searchStoryDialog_104012002":"It was a little cold at night, so Bei Ran picked some branches back and mad a bonfire. The branches were burning and crackling, your sight moved between Bei Ran and the bonfire constantly.",
"searchStoryDialog_104012003":"Are you cold?",
"searchStoryDialog_104012004":"You nodded. The coldness didn't come from the temperature, but the feeling of unsafe because you sat far away from Bei Ran. You fear that he would disappear again when you fall asleep.",
"searchStoryDialog_104012005":"Come here.",
"searchStoryDialog_104012006":"You obediently moved closer to him to a distance of a fist, he didn't respond, you moved again, this time you could feel his body heat.",
"searchStoryDialog_104012007":"He glanced at you silently, throwing a small branch into the fire, a small cluster of fire rose. You yawned, feeling tired after a long time.",
"searchStoryDialog_104012008":"By the time you were woken by the sun the next day, you found yourself sleeping on the lap of Bei Ran. You were also covered with the shirt of Bei Ran.",
"searchStoryDialog_104012009":"(Got up quickly) My...my thanks! For the pillow and the protection.",
"searchStoryDialog_104012010":"I owe you a lot, I don't know how to pay it back...",
"searchStoryDialog_104012011":"Then keep owing.",
"searchStoryDialog_104012012":"But what if you wouldn't let me pay back for the rest of my life?",
"searchStoryDialog_104012013":"Then keep owing for your lifetime.",
"searchStoryDialog_104013001":"Today you set out for the woods, humming a delightful song while walking. Suddenly a wind strike you up to the air, you found yourself flying.",
"searchStoryDialog_104013002":"(Frightened) Ah——! !! Argh! Argh!",
"searchStoryDialog_104013003":"(Covers your mouth) Keep quiet, it's me.",
"searchStoryDialog_104013004":"With you in his arms, Bei Ran stepped through the cloud and landed on an open field in the wilderness.",
"searchStoryDialog_104013005":"Come out, it's not the time to play hide and seek.",
"searchStoryDialog_104013006":"Several masked men in black came out from the woods.",
"searchStoryDialog_104013007":"Who goes there? You are getting in the way of the prince!",
"searchStoryDialog_104013008":"(Scorn) I could care less about the prince, my name is Bei Ran, and you're welcome to try.",
"searchStoryDialog_104013009":"The name has definitely terrified the men in black, a moment later, they decided to retreat from the field. Bei Ran didn't chase, nor did he release you from his arms.",
"searchStoryDialog_104013010":"(Shy) You...Ahem...",
"searchStoryDialog_104013011":"They won't show up again, at least for now.",
"searchStoryDialog_104013012":"I mean... your hands...",
"searchStoryDialog_104013013":"Bei Ran looked down, seeing his hands were around your chest and realized what you meant. He put down his hand with a slight blush on his face.",
"searchStoryDialog_104013014":"(Blush) I, I will be responsible for this.",
"searchStoryDialog_104014001":"You are on the way to return to your mansion, you feel bored and summoned Bei Ran.",
"searchStoryDialog_104014002":"Are you bored?",
"searchStoryDialog_104014003":"Yes, I would like some company. We could walk in the woods too. You don't have to come if you're busy.",
"searchStoryDialog_104014004":"Just get to the point.",
"searchStoryDialog_104014005":"Well, I wonder if it's embarrassing for you to accompany me like this every time.",
"searchStoryDialog_104014006":"...... No.",
"searchStoryDialog_104014007":"No? What does it mean no? Did you mean it's not embarrassing at all?",
"searchStoryDialog_104014008":"(Points to the noisy sparrows) You're just like them.",
"searchStoryDialog_104014009":"You mean I'm a cute bird? But I'm dressed in a uniform, I don't look like a lady at the moment.",
"searchStoryDialog_104014010":"Noisy.",
"searchStoryDialog_104015001":"As of recently, if you haven't been to the woods for a long time, Bei Ran would take the liberty and come to you instead. You heard Bei Ran coming in through the window again and didn't even lift your head.",
"searchStoryDialog_104015002":"Welcome.",
"searchStoryDialog_104015003":"Thanks.",
"searchStoryDialog_104015004":"Bei Ran would sit by your side for the whole night, and occasionally read some of your books. If you fall asleep revising the documents, he will put you back to your bed.",
"searchStoryDialog_104015005":"This kind of tacit understanding reminded you of seasoned couples. You let out a cough and dragged your mind back to the reality.",
"searchStoryDialog_104015006":"Not feeling well?",
"searchStoryDialog_104015007":"No, I'm fine. Would you like to lie down on the bed for a while?",
"searchStoryDialog_104015008":"No, thank you.",
"searchStoryDialog_104015009":"As you continued to revise the documents, you saw Bei Ran fell asleep for the first time.",
"searchStoryDialog_104015010":"It's a little cold in autumn, you wanted take a coat to cover him, but when you walked up to him, he opened his eyes.",
"searchStoryDialog_104015011":"He saw you and closed his eyes again, you put the coat on him, double checking to make sure it won't fall off.",
"searchStoryDialog_104016001":"Today you're taking a walking in the woods with Bei Ran, you wish to ask him some questions.",
"searchStoryDialog_104016002":"(Cautiously) Well... I would like to ask you some questions, you must answer me honestly!",
"searchStoryDialog_104016003":"(Eyes became erratic) Otherwise, I will never summon you again!",
"searchStoryDialog_104016004":"Bei Ran looked at you with an indifferent face as usual. You looked at his eyes, noticing that the ice inside has already melted.",
"searchStoryDialog_104016005":"Well... Why are you being to nice to me?",
"searchStoryDialog_104016006":"(Remained silent for a moment) ... Because you're like my dead sister.",
"searchStoryDialog_104016007":"He told you the story of his past, in a calmly way, as if he was telling a story of someone else.",
"searchStoryDialog_104016008":"But you knew the weight he was carrying was not as simple as his description. When he finished telling the story, you felt sorry for what he had to been through, and you feel a little down for yourself.",
"searchStoryDialog_104016009":"(Whisper) ... It turns out I'm just a sister to you.",
"searchStoryDialog_104016010":"But I know you're not her.",
"searchStoryDialog_104016011":"You looked up and meet his sight.",
"searchStoryDialog_104016012":"...... I haven't felt this feeling before, it's not a feeling to a sister.",
"searchStoryDialog_104016013":"Do you hate me for doing this?",
"searchStoryDialog_104016014":"You held his hand, with all fingers crossed. He gave you a smile, like a naughty sun sneak-peaking behind the clouds, shedding a warm light on your Beautiful face. He didn't answer, but the two of you were holding each other's hand with ten fingers crossed.",
"searchStoryDialog_104017001":"The Qixi Festival has come for the year, you invited Bei Ran to the market to buy a river lamp. The streets were too crowded tonight, so you brought Bei Ran to a quiet riverside.",
"searchStoryDialog_104017002":"You lit the lamp and put it into the river. As the lamp gradually drifted away, you closed your eyes and fingers crossed.",
"searchStoryDialog_104017003":"What did you wish for?",
"searchStoryDialog_104017004":"It won't work if I tell you.",
"searchStoryDialog_104017005":"I can fulfill all of your wishes.",
"searchStoryDialog_104017006":"(Blush) ... Will you accompany me?",
"searchStoryDialog_104017007":"Isn't that already fulfilled?",
"searchStoryDialog_104017008":"No! I mean... Accompany me... like forever...",
"searchStoryDialog_104017009":"You were afraid of Bei Ran's answer, but he gave you a special one.",
"searchStoryDialog_104017010":"I have a good reputation amongst my clients that I will complete any job they gave me.",
"searchStoryDialog_104017011":"(Nervous) So....?",
"searchStoryDialog_104017012":"He turned to you with a smile and said...",
"searchStoryDialog_104017013":"(Lips by your ears) This job of yours, I will take it.",
"searchStoryDialog_104018001":"Today you went to the city for a walk but you lost your way and ended up in an place of unknown. Suddenly, a few men in black with blades in their hand appeared from the shadow, smiling at you with evil intension.",
"searchStoryDialog_104018002":"They were getting closer and closer, forcing you into a corner. Suddenly, you noticed a familiar smile, it's the smile of [Misty Brothel]! Then, a man in dark blue appeared beside you.",
"searchStoryDialog_104018003":"You looked up to the man, his cold eyes are staring at the bandits.",
"searchStoryDialog_104018004":"As the man was guarding you closely, you confirmed the smile was indeed from [Misty Brothel]. The battle didn't last long before the bandits started to flee.",
"searchStoryDialog_104018005":"Just as you wanted to thank the man, he was gone, like the wind. You thought to yourself that maybe you could meet him in the [Misty Brothel] again.",
"searchStoryDialog_204001001":"Late at night, you arrived at Misty Brothel and found only Sister Hua there. Sister Hua came up to you smiling and put a note inside your robe.",
"searchStoryDialog_204001002":"My lord, the job is done, may I have my reward?",
"searchStoryDialog_204001003":"Sister, aren't we acquaintances already, acquaintances help each other for free, you know?",
"searchStoryDialog_204001004":"My lord, a job is a job, no matter the relationship, you know?",
"searchStoryDialog_204001005":"Everything has an exception maybe?",
"searchStoryDialog_204001006":"You wouldn't let go of Hua's hand as she did the same to you.",
"searchStoryDialog_204001007":"You're the most important person to me, nobody can replace your place inside my heart.",
"searchStoryDialog_204001008":"Sweet words, my lord, I hope you keep the promise. A discount then, just gave me this number...",
"searchStoryDialog_204001009":"Sister Hua wrote a number on your palm while leaning on your chest.",
"searchStoryDialog_204001010":"Over the years, you and Hua supported each other on many things. It would seem that the two of you are going to share a wonderful night again.",
"searchStoryDialog_105001001":"Today, Hanlin Academy invited you to participate in an poetry contest, as a main judge.",
"searchStoryDialog_105001002":"Though the participant scholars bored you with their average performance yet arrogant words. A scholar with simple clothing slowly came up to you and gracefully bowed to you.",
"searchStoryDialog_105001003":"The scholar read a few of his poetry and you immediately knew that he was an exceptionally one.",
"searchStoryDialog_105001004":"Your servant whispered to you that he is the city's top scholar— Lu Qichi.",
"searchStoryDialog_105001005":"Bravo, you're worthy of your title.",
"searchStoryDialog_105001006":"(Blush) Thank you, my lord.",
"searchStoryDialog_105001007":"My lord, in fact, I only came to this contest because of you.",
"searchStoryDialog_105001008":"His eyes were full of reverence, rendering you started to be proud of yourself.",
"searchStoryDialog_105001009":"(Looking forward) May I be a student of yours, my lord?",
"searchStoryDialog_105001010":"Feeling his sincere attitude, you agreed his propose.",
"searchStoryDialog_105002001":"As you were roaming the garden today, you found someone painting.",
"searchStoryDialog_105002002":"You walked up to the painter and he didn't notice you were there. As he finished the last swipe, the paint is completed, Lu Qichi put down his pen with satisfaction.",
"searchStoryDialog_105002003":"That's an excellent painting, Lu.",
"searchStoryDialog_105002004":"Lu Qichi was shocked by your sudden praise. After he realized it was you, he smiled with a shy look.",
"searchStoryDialog_105002005":"(Shy) Thank you my lord.",
"searchStoryDialog_105002006":"You can skip the [my lord] when we're not at court.",
"searchStoryDialog_105002007":"I'm afraid I can't do that...",
"searchStoryDialog_105002008":"Although Lu is trying to say no, but you knew he wanted to be bound closer to you.",
"searchStoryDialog_105002009":"(Tough) Just listen to me, okay?",
"searchStoryDialog_105002010":"(Delight) Okay.",
"searchStoryDialog_105003001":"The garden is a quiet place that is suitable for poetry and painting. You found Lu Qichi there again, he was looking at somewhere afar.",
"searchStoryDialog_105003002":"Jump-scare him",
"searchStoryDialog_105003003":"You sneaked behind him and pad his shoulder heavily.",
"searchStoryDialog_105003004":"(Frightened) Ah! !!",
"searchStoryDialog_105003005":"You looked at his scared fear and laughed out loud.",
"searchStoryDialog_105003006":"(Joy) That's it! That's right, this is it!",
"searchStoryDialog_105003007":"You saw Lu picked up the pen and wrote down two lines of a poem on a white paper. You read the poem and praised it wholeheartedly.",
"searchStoryDialog_105003008":"(Appreciate) Lu, what a good poem! The poem described the Beauty of the garden in just a few words, it's indeed excellent.",
"searchStoryDialog_105003009":"It was you who gave me the inspiration just now, if not for your padding, I could still be stuck there.",
"searchStoryDialog_105003010":"You repeatedly recited Lu's new poem, appreciating the words constantly. He embarrassedly pinched the book in his hand and was quite satisfied with his poetry.",
"searchStoryDialog_105003011":"Wait for him by his side",
"searchStoryDialog_105003012":"He walked back and forth with the book in his head, shaking his head from time to time. A moment later, he noticed that you were observing him, you walked up to him and asked about his trouble.",
"searchStoryDialog_105003013":"I wrote half of a verse today, but I couldn't be satisfied with the other half.",
"searchStoryDialog_105003014":"He wrote the verse on the paper, you looked at it and mused for a moment.",
"searchStoryDialog_105003015":"You replaced some words in his verse and asked about his opinion.",
"searchStoryDialog_105003016":"(Delighted) That were some good changes!",
"searchStoryDialog_105003017":"His spirit is lit up, he picked up the pen and finished the entire poem in a matter of seconds, followed by showing it to you immediately.",
"searchStoryDialog_105003018":"You nodded to him, smiling, it was a respectfully praise.",
"searchStoryDialog_105004001":"You found a manuscript in your study this morning. You read the first page and realized that it was written by Lu Qichi.",
"searchStoryDialog_105004002":"You continued the reading, recalling that you found the book in a book store seven days ago. You wanted to buy the book, but the book was too much of a treasure for the owner to sell.",
"searchStoryDialog_105004003":"Seeing your love for the book, Lu Qichi begged the owner to have the book copied by himself.",
"searchStoryDialog_105004004":"The handwriting on this manuscript was clean, concise, and without a single misspelling. You can feel his sincerity.",
"searchStoryDialog_105004005":"A few moments later, Lu came to visit you and you showed your gratitude to him.",
"searchStoryDialog_105004006":"(Shy) I'm glad to serve. You borrowed the book that day.",
"searchStoryDialog_105004007":"(Worried) The owner loved the book so much, he won't be borrowing it out for long. You have copied the book in just a few days, your hands must be very tired.",
"searchStoryDialog_105004008":"You held him right hand and started to give it a massage. He had a typical scholar's skin— thin and white, you rubbed it for a few times and it turned red. When you looked up to see his face, he was already blushing.",
"searchStoryDialog_105005001":"Today you heard someone reading [The Analects of Confucius] to a group of Children on the street.",
"searchStoryDialog_105005002":"You sought out the sound and found that the teacher was Lu Qichi.",
"searchStoryDialog_105005003":"When Lu Qichi noticed you, he smiled with a shyly look. After arranged the homework for the Children, he walked up to you.",
"searchStoryDialog_105005004":"How do you know I'm here?",
"searchStoryDialog_105005005":"Just passing by, why are you doing this?",
"searchStoryDialog_105005006":"I'm just wish those poor kids can have some decent education.",
"searchStoryDialog_105005007":"You were a little touched by his noble move.",
"searchStoryDialog_105006001":"It's the new year again. While patrolling, you found a crowd gathering together around a familiar face.",
"searchStoryDialog_105006002":"A lady holding a spring festival scroll kept praising Lu Qichi. She praised that Lu Qichi would write scrolls for the town folks for free every year.",
"searchStoryDialog_105006003":"Glad I can help, it's my responsibility.",
"searchStoryDialog_105006004":"The town folks never stopped asking, and Lu Qichi never stopped writing.",
"searchStoryDialog_105006005":"He went on and on and never seemed tired.",
"searchStoryDialog_105006006":"You wanted to go in and say hello, but when you saw the concentration in this eyes, you left quietly.",
"searchStoryDialog_105007001":"You have to set out for Jiangnan for public affairs, Lu Qichi was there to send you off. He looked very sad and his mind was wandering out there somewhere.",
"searchStoryDialog_105007002":"I'll be returning very soon, don't worry.",
"searchStoryDialog_105007003":"(Sighing) I'll be very sad if you're not around.",
"searchStoryDialog_105007004":"(Console) It won't be long, I promise.",
"searchStoryDialog_105007005":"Say, how about you going with me?",
"searchStoryDialog_105007006":"(Surprise) This, I'm afraid it's not right...",
"searchStoryDialog_105007007":"It's okay, as long as you are not afraid of being tired on the road.",
"searchStoryDialog_105007008":"(Shaking head) Well, I won't force you, you have an exam to overcome after all.",
"searchStoryDialog_105007009":"It's time to go, the boat was slowly leaving the shore. Suddenly you heard Lu Qichi singing, he was trying to bid you farewell.",
"searchStoryDialog_105007010":"A few days after you left, you received a letter from Lu Qichi. There are only six words on the letter, [Missing you, waiting for you. — Qichi.]",
"searchStoryDialog_105008001":"Today you went to look for Lu Qichi, just as you stepped into the courtyard, you heard the cry of a Child. A Child with the age of three or four was crying while pulling Lu Qichi. Lu Qichi looks helpless, and hardly knew what to do.",
"searchStoryDialog_105008002":"(Resisting laughing) What is wrong, Lu?",
"searchStoryDialog_105008003":"The Child seemed to be lost, and as soon as he saw me, he asked me to find his mother.",
"searchStoryDialog_105008004":"When the Child saw you coming, he stopped a moment before calling out for daddy, and then started to cry loudly again.",
"searchStoryDialog_105008005":"You had a look at Lu Qichi, and he looked at you, he was a little embarrassed but looks pretty happy.",
"searchStoryDialog_105008006":"(Looking embarrassed) What should we do?",
"searchStoryDialog_105008007":"(Resist laughing) Try holding him up and give him some pet. I'll have my servants to ask around.",
"searchStoryDialog_105008008":"I.....",
"searchStoryDialog_105008009":"Lu Qichi held the Child up and started to pet him into sleep. After a while the Child had finally become too tired to cry, he lied on Lu Qichi's shoulder and fell asleep.",
"searchStoryDialog_105009001":"It's a fine day, so you invited Lu Qichi to boating outside. The boat floated down to the center of the lake, just as you wanted to row the boat back to shore, the boat didn't not move at all.",
"searchStoryDialog_105009002":"This boat...",
"searchStoryDialog_105009003":"(Embarrassing) Lu, in fact... I can't row a boat.",
"searchStoryDialog_105009004":"(Looking embarrassed) Well... I can't either.",
"searchStoryDialog_105009005":"The two of you looked at each other for a moment and decided to try your best. Eventually, the boat lost balance and was turned over. Fortunately, you and Lu Qichi can swim, you two made your way back to the shore.",
"searchStoryDialog_105009006":"You seem to be... a little fat.",
"searchStoryDialog_105009007":"You're psychologically prepared to be noticed when you're in the water, but you didn't know how to answer it.",
"searchStoryDialog_105009008":"I've been busy with my official business, maybe I am lack of exercise.",
"searchStoryDialog_105009009":"Sages said...",
"searchStoryDialog_105009010":"Seeing that Lu Qichi was about to give you a lesson, you stopped him with a proposal.",
"searchStoryDialog_105009011":"Nonsense, I'm not fat, it's you who is too slim.",
"searchStoryDialog_105009012":"Am I?",
"searchStoryDialog_105009013":"Yes, that's right. Come on, let's go back to mansion and have some food to heat up.",
"searchStoryDialog_105010001":"This day the dark clouds covered the sky, there will be a rainstorm. Lu Qichi suddenly opened your door.",
"searchStoryDialog_105010002":"(Surprised) Qichi, why you came over suddenly.",
"searchStoryDialog_105010003":"(Become serious) I got a rare book, we need to have a discussion.",
"searchStoryDialog_105010004":"While the conversation is going on, a white light fell outside the window, and then you heard the thunder rolling. Lu Qichi suddenly grabbed your hand.",
"searchStoryDialog_105010005":"(Pretend to be calm) Don't be afraid, just thunder.",
"searchStoryDialog_105010006":"(Confused) I didn't say I was afraid...",
"searchStoryDialog_105010007":"The wind blew the trees outside the house, followed by a thunder that sounded deafening.",
"searchStoryDialog_105010008":"(Scared)! !!",
"searchStoryDialog_105010009":"Lu Qichi's face was rendered white, and his body trembled unconsciously. You suddenly had thought that maybe he came to you because he was afraid of thunder.",
"searchStoryDialog_105010010":"(Hands can't stop shaking) Take it easy!",
"searchStoryDialog_105010011":"You thought he was lovely, you pulled him into the house and sat with him whiling clenching his hands.",
"searchStoryDialog_105010012":"(Softly) Do not be afraid, I am here.",
"searchStoryDialog_105010013":"(Calm down a little) Please don't leave me!",
"searchStoryDialog_105011001":"You and Lu Qichi went out for a hiking in spring. You noticed that the garden was full of scholars and ladies of various rich families.",
"searchStoryDialog_105011002":"Lu, do you have a lover?",
"searchStoryDialog_105011003":"(Nervous) A scholar must study first...",
"searchStoryDialog_105011004":"Seeing his blushing face, you started to bully him for fun.",
"searchStoryDialog_105011005":"Qichi, what's with your face, are you in a fever?",
"searchStoryDialog_105011006":"You reached out to touch his cheeks, it was so hot that it burnt your hands. You touched his forehead, but this time it's normal.",
"searchStoryDialog_105011007":"(Blush) Yes, it's easy to catch cold in early spring, maybe we should return ...",
"searchStoryDialog_105011008":"May I introduce a fine lady to you?",
"searchStoryDialog_105011009":"(Nervous) No, I don't need it, I mean it. !! I have someone I love, but she didn't know my heart.",
"searchStoryDialog_105011010":"Well if you don't tell me, I'll never know.",
"searchStoryDialog_105011011":"Cough, cough, it's getting late, let's go home.",
"searchStoryDialog_105012001":"You haven't seen Lu Qichi for a few days now, you went to visit him but only to found that the gate was shut.",
"searchStoryDialog_105012002":"Qichi! Qichi! Are you home?",
"searchStoryDialog_105012003":"(Noisy) Yes! I'm coming now!",
"searchStoryDialog_105012004":"You didn't know what Qichi was doing, so you decided to...",
"searchStoryDialog_105012005":"Open the door and have look",
"searchStoryDialog_105012006":"You were a little worried and pushed the door open, only to found a lot of paper scattered on the ground. As soon as you want to have a look, Lu Qichi stopped you.",
"searchStoryDialog_105012007":"Wait for him outside the door",
"searchStoryDialog_105012008":"After a long time Lu Qichi came out in a flurry, you wanted to see what is in the room but was stopped by him.",
"searchStoryDialog_105012009":"(Nervous)What are you doing here.",
"searchStoryDialog_105012010":"I'm worried about you because I haven't seen you for a few days, so I come to have a look.",
"searchStoryDialog_105012011":"I'm fine, maybe we can meet up another day?",
"searchStoryDialog_105012012":"You were pushed out of the room by him, he was a little unusual today, but you didn't want to force him, so you went home.",
"searchStoryDialog_105013001":"This day you go to the mansion and found Lu Qichi holding some eggs and fruits, waiting by the doorway. You walked up to him.",
"searchStoryDialog_105013002":"You: What's this?",
"searchStoryDialog_105013003":"(Shy) The Children's parents gave me all this.",
"searchStoryDialog_105013004":"My lord, it was your policy that gave them a chance to be educated, they were all praising your deeds.",
"searchStoryDialog_105013005":"My thanks to them, but this I cannot take.",
"searchStoryDialog_105013006":"(Awkward) I knew you can't, but I can't shove away their kindness either.",
"searchStoryDialog_105013007":"You threw yourself into a deep thought.",
"searchStoryDialog_105013008":"Fine, how about you keep them for me. After all, you're their teacher and I come to you a lot.",
"searchStoryDialog_105013009":"Lu Qichi agreed. After that, you walked him home while holding some of those gifts.",
"searchStoryDialog_105014001":"Today you're reading books with Lu Qichi, he stopped his reading when the verse [A fair lady is a gentleman's desire] came up.",
"searchStoryDialog_105014002":"Are you interested in some lady yet?",
"searchStoryDialog_105014003":"Why you ask me about this suddenly.",
"searchStoryDialog_105014004":"Just a thought, that maybe you have a lot of [admirers].",
"searchStoryDialog_105014005":"(Lonely) When you get married, I guess I won't come bothering you again.",
"searchStoryDialog_105014006":"He looked unhappy.",
"searchStoryDialog_105014007":"If you do have a wife, you must spend a lot of time with her, not me. Then I will be alone again.",
"searchStoryDialog_105014008":"He looked lonely. You recall that you haven't seen his family since you met him. He was always alone.",
"searchStoryDialog_105014009":"You couldn't bear to think about it. And you're used to his company, you have to admit that you have feelings for him. Besides...... You can't have a wife.",
"searchStoryDialog_105014010":"Well, you can come as long as you like.",
"searchStoryDialog_105014011":"Haha, you are the best.",
"searchStoryDialog_105014012":"Lu Qichi reached out his little finger, you looked at this rather Childish move, smiled. You reached out your little fingers and clenched it with his.",
"searchStoryDialog_105015001":"It's your birthday today, a feast was taking place in the courtyard. You invited Lu Qichi to the party and he came with a Beautiful painting in his hand.",
"searchStoryDialog_105015002":"(Happy) Happy birthday. I painted a picture as a birthday gift, hope you like it.",
"searchStoryDialog_105015003":"You opened the scroll, it was a picture of hiking. Besides the scenery, you also see two scholars on it.",
"searchStoryDialog_105015004":"You recalled that you were hiking with Lu Qichi not long ago.",
"searchStoryDialog_105015005":"And maybe he was preparing this painting on the day he refused to let you get in his house.",
"searchStoryDialog_105015006":"Do you like it?",
"searchStoryDialog_105015007":"Lu Qichi was waiting for your answer. You turned back and hugged him.",
"searchStoryDialog_105015008":"I like his painting very much, I can also feel your heart too.",
"searchStoryDialog_105015009":"Lu Qichi seemed relieved, you invited him to sit with you and shared a wonderful night with him.",
"searchStoryDialog_105016001":"Today you and Lu Qichi are drinking tea in the garden.",
"searchStoryDialog_105016002":"Qichi, why would you study with me rather than with those who have more wisdom than me.",
"searchStoryDialog_105016003":"(Nervous) Are you tired of me?",
"searchStoryDialog_105016004":"Seeing his clenched fists, you know that he took it too seriously...",
"searchStoryDialog_105016005":"Easy, I'm just curious.",
"searchStoryDialog_105016006":"Lu Qichi let out a sigh and explained:",
"searchStoryDialog_105016007":"You are an ideal official for the people, my lord.",
"searchStoryDialog_105016008":"I would rather to be a man who fights the violent and assist the weak, seeking welfare for the people, rather than a scholar filled with empty knowledge but no practical achievements.",
"searchStoryDialog_105016009":"When he said this, his eyes are full of worship for you, you were glad to have such a good bro.",
"searchStoryDialog_105016010":"I am an official, so you know, sometimes I have to be alone.",
"searchStoryDialog_105016011":"(Lonely) Understood, I won't be bothering you anymore.",
"searchStoryDialog_105016012":"You realized he took it seriously and said.",
"searchStoryDialog_105016013":"Hey I was kidding, don't leave. Having you by my side makes me very happy.",
"searchStoryDialog_105016014":"He seemed happier after hearing your words, you made him to smile after reassuring him with your true thoughts.",
"searchStoryDialog_105017001":"Today you found Lu Qichi was practicing calligraphy, it's a copy of a calligraphy master Yan Zhenqing's work.",
"searchStoryDialog_105017002":"You walked up and had a discussion with him. A little more admiration and love came into Lu Qichi's eyes.",
"searchStoryDialog_105017003":"(Confused) There is a place where I always mess up.",
"searchStoryDialog_105017004":"Lu Qichi pointed to a word on the scroll, you thought it's best to show him directly, so you held his hand from behind and started to teach him how to write the word.",
"searchStoryDialog_105017005":"Go harder there, and lighter here, then done.",
"searchStoryDialog_105017006":"Qichi, do you have a fever, Why your face is so red?",
"searchStoryDialog_105017007":"Lu Qichi was blushing like a boiled shrimp, his body is trembling and words could not be let out. You helped him to sit and gave him a book to calm down.",
"searchStoryDialog_105018001":"Today you invited Lu Qichi to have a discussion about poetry, you had a wonderful session, but when it was finished, it's already at dawn, so you had him to stay for the night.",
"searchStoryDialog_105018002":"After dinner, Lu Qichi and you were having a poetry contest with liquor.",
"searchStoryDialog_105018003":"(Drunk) Cheers, my dear lord!",
"searchStoryDialog_105018004":"You lifted your glass and drunk it all. Lu Qichi is a little drunk and he said a lot more daring words than usual. You looked at him and thought to yourself that he is a lot cuter than he usually is.",
"searchStoryDialog_105018005":"Suddenly, Lu Qichi stood up, held your hand and started to walk towards your room.",
"searchStoryDialog_105018006":"Let's be brothers!",
"searchStoryDialog_105018007":"He was drunk, you could only do what he said. The two of you kneed on the ground and started to salute.",
"searchStoryDialog_105018008":"First, to the heaven and earth! (Salute) Second, to the parents! (Salute) To your spouse!",
"searchStoryDialog_105018009":"Qichi, that's not right.",
"searchStoryDialog_105018010":"(Confused) Huh? Exactly.",
"searchStoryDialog_105018011":"You want to marry me?",
"searchStoryDialog_105018012":"Spouse? Hehehe....hehehe...",
"searchStoryDialog_105018013":"Lu Qichi laughed for a few seconds and passed out.",
"searchStoryDialog_105019001":"What an exciting night. It was still a little cold at night, you put him in bed and wanted to leave, but he held your hand.",
"searchStoryDialog_105019002":"Qichi, just sleep, you're drunk.",
"searchStoryDialog_105019003":"You too...",
"searchStoryDialog_105019004":"He wouldn't let go of your hand, so you had to sleep by his side.",
"searchStoryDialog_105019005":"How can you sleep without undressing...",
"searchStoryDialog_105019006":"He grabbed your cloth with one hand tightly, as if he would kept making trouble if you didn't take off your cloth.",
"searchStoryDialog_105019007":"Undress",
"searchStoryDialog_105019008":"Unable to dissuade him, you let your guard down and undressed your outer robe.",
"searchStoryDialog_105019009":"As soon as you laid down, Lu Qichi fell asleep deeply.",
"searchStoryDialog_105019010":"Don't undress",
"searchStoryDialog_105019011":"This... This is not allowed!",
"searchStoryDialog_105019012":"Why not!",
"searchStoryDialog_105019013":"Lu Qichi tried to reason with you. As he went on and on, his voice got weaker and weaker.",
"searchStoryDialog_105019014":"You covered him with a quilt and laid down beside him.",
"searchStoryDialog_105019015":"I like you...",
"searchStoryDialog_105019016":"He began to talk nonsense in his sleep, you yawned and went to sleep too.",
"searchStoryDialog_105020001":"You and Lu Qichi are taking a walk on the street. Suddenly, a girl rushed to your side, gave you something, and ran away while looking at you shyly. You looked down and found a sachet.",
"searchStoryDialog_105020002":"(Jealous) Aren't that supposed to be a good fortune?",
"searchStoryDialog_105020003":"You know Lu Qichi was not happy and started to respond.",
"searchStoryDialog_105020004":"(Smiling) This is troublesome, Qichi, what should I do.",
"searchStoryDialog_105020005":"I would say that the girls are all unworthy of you.",
"searchStoryDialog_105020006":"You possess the greatest wisdom, appearance and personality, how can they dare to dream of marrying you?",
"searchStoryDialog_105020007":"So what kind of person can marry me?",
"searchStoryDialog_105020008":"You looked at Lu Qichi's frowning face and felt funny.",
"searchStoryDialog_105020009":"(Tease) Maybe you could be someone who is worthy, Qichi?",
"searchStoryDialog_105020010":"Lu Qichi started to panic, he face turned from white to red, and from red to crimson. He turned away from you and dared not to look at you.",
"searchStoryDialog_105020011":"Please do not make fun of me! !!",
"searchStoryDialog_105020012":"What if I am not kidding?",
"searchStoryDialog_105020013":"(Eyes can't stop peeking at you) Well... if you insists, then I can only obey!",
"searchStoryDialog_105021001":"It's sunny today, and you wandered into the famous bookstore in the city. You were about to pick up a book, but your hand was covered by another hand.",
"searchStoryDialog_105021002":"It was a scholar's hand, he was born with peachy eyes, and there is a tear mole beneath one of his eyes. He took back his hand quickly, looking embarrassed.",
"searchStoryDialog_105021003":"(Shy) Sorry for the trouble, you came first.",
"searchStoryDialog_105021004":"The scholar looked funny with a blushing face. You thought so, and handed him the book. The scholar's face turned crimson, he took the book while kept saying thank you.",
"searchStoryDialog_105021005":"Thank you, should you wish to read the book, please seek me out in [Prospect Garden].",
"searchStoryDialog_205001001":"With a frowned face, you rushed to the garden and found Lin Daiyu leaning on a pillar.",
"searchStoryDialog_205001002":"(Apologies) How are you?",
"searchStoryDialog_205001003":"Lin Daiyu nodded slightly, a tear was shed from her eyes.",
"searchStoryDialog_205001004":"(Sobbing) I thought you wouldn't come again.",
"searchStoryDialog_205001005":"(Painful and anxious) How could I? I've been very busy lately, but I came as soon as I finished.",
"searchStoryDialog_205001006":"Send me a letter if you wish to see me, I'll be right there right away.",
"searchStoryDialog_205001007":"Lin Daiyu shook her head and looked at the woods afar.",
"searchStoryDialog_205001008":"If you do not wish to see me, why insist on it. Let me do the missing and it will be enough.",
"searchStoryDialog_205001009":"You wiped out the tear for her.",
"searchStoryDialog_205001010":"I'll never leave you, my heart belongs to you.",
"searchStoryDialog_205001011":"Lin Daiyu smiled, so did you.",

"acThreeKingdomsRule-1":"<font color=0xfeffc7><font color=0x00ff00>[Faction Clash]</font>This event is a Cross-Server one. Qualified players can participate in this event during the opening time. New players should select one out of three Factions to participate. During event, siege Jingzhou and Red Cliff on Saturday and Sunday nights to obtain Clash Score. The final ranking will be settled after the end of event according to Clash Score. No.1 player will obtain <font color=0xfedb38>Supreme King Title-[King of Unity] and other generous rewards</font>\n\n<font color=0x00ff00>[Rations and Provisions]</font><font color=0xfedb38>Special Instruction: Rations and Provisions in this event will be cleared after the end of each Round. Please claim Rations and Provisions in time and use them as soon as possible</font>\n\n<font color=0x00ff00>[Recommended Faction]</font>The system will recommend the Faction with less members to players. Select and join the Recommended Faction to obtain a reward of 100 Ingots. Moreover, many Rankings in this event are settled within Faction. Select the Recommended Faction to enjoy a higher chance of getting better Ranking rewards\n\n<font color=0x00ff00>[Event Introduction]</font>Players can dispatch Retainers from every Monday to Friday to complete Quests. Having dispatched Retainers to Quests, you can claim Quest rewards when the Quest countdown hits 0. From Saturday to Sunday, there will be a Siege in the morning and another in the afternoon. Players can attack opponent cities or defend their own cities. During the end of each Round on Saturday and Sunday, Jingzhou Rampage and Red Cliff Rampage. You can participate and obtain Clash Score in them\n\n<font color=0x00ff00>[Faction Leaders]</font>By the end of each week, Top 3 players in each Faction will be conferred as Viceroy, Secretariat and Registrar respectively in the next week. Viceroy has the right to enact Commands which will increase the Attribute of allies in specific cities during Sieges\n\n<font color=0x00ff00>[Dispatch Quest]</font>In the first week of Faction Clash, cities belong to your Faction will provide you with 4 selectable Quests. From the second week on, the selectable Quests will increase to 5. Dispatch Quests have requirements of Retainer Aptitude. Retainers below requirements cannot be dispatched. You can consume Ingots to promote Quest Rewards and lower the requirement of Retainer Aptitude. Unclaimed Quest Rewards will be issued to you via Mail. As long as you have dispatched Retainers, you can complete the corresponding Quests and claim Quest Rewards from Mail even the Quest time exceeds the remaining time of that day. Completing Dispatch Quest not only grants individual rewards, but also accumulate Divine EXP for your Faction. It will upgrade Cheer Level and enhance the strength of all Retainers from your Faction in Sieges\n\n<font color=0x00ff00>[Siege]</font>When Siege opens, there will be 6 cities on the map. Each Faction takes control of 2 of them. You can select a city and battle in it. Occupation of a stronghold gives 1 Occupation Score per second. Each battle grants Siege Score(during Siege) or Clash Score(during Rampage) according to your total Strength\n\nIn Sieges, players’ Characters from both sides fight the first battle. The victor will obtain a buff on his follow-up Retainers and enable them to take upper hand in the 1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th battles. After the first battle, Retainers from both sides will be dispatched in a descending order. The Retainer whose HP drops to 0 is considered defeated and will be substituted by the next one until all Retainers from one side are defeated. Retainers are not restricted by winning streak in Faction Clash and thus do not retreat until their HP drop to 0. When a player defeats another, the victor’s formation will stay in the stronghold with status after battle(including remaining Retainers and Retainer HP) and wait for the next challenger\n\nDuring offense, there are different situations according to the nature of the troop in the stronghold:\nIf the troop in the stronghold is an opponent, there will be a battle and the victor will stay\nIf the troop in the stronghold is an NPC garrison, as long as your Strength is higher than the NPC, you will occupy this stronghold without any loss of status\nIf the troop in the stronghold is an ally, and when your Strength is 2 times higher than your ally’s, it will trigger a relief, which means your troop will replace your ally’s troop and stay in the stronghold instead\n\nWhen a player dispatches a troop in a Siege, it will attach a Reinforcement with the same strength as the dispatched troop to this city. Reinforcement will enhance Retainer Attribute for other players from your Faction when they battle in this city\n\nWhen the Round of Siege is over, the ownership of a city will be settled according to Occupation Score. The Faction with the highest Occupation Score will take control of this city. All players in the winning Faction will be able to claim Occupation Reward. When the next Round of Siege begins, the ownership of cities will be reset\n\n<font color=0x00ff00>[Heated Fighting Spirit]</font>When 2 Characters/Retainers are fighting each other, their Attack will be doubled every 5 turns until one of them is defeated. After that, their Attack will be reset to the default value\n\n<font color=0x00ff00>[Rations and Provisions]</font>In Faction Clash, Siege battles require the consumption of specific Items. Usual Sieges require Rations while Rampage Sieges require Provisions. If players are ranked high in CS events during Faction Clash, these players can claim Provisions as reward. The rewards for CS Ranking settled at 22:00 on Sunday will be available in the next Round of Faction Clash. Also, completing top-up tasks at weekend in [War Room] grants Rations and Provisions as rewards. <font color=0xfedb38>Rations and Provisions will be cleared after the end of the week </font>\n\n<font color=0x00ff00>[Divine Assault]</font>When Faction Clash enters the 4th week, Divine Assault will be activated. Divine Generals from each Faction will assault the opponent headquarters from Monday to Friday in the evening. Defeat the invading Divine General to obtain rewards\n\n<font color=0x00ff00>[Faction Score]</font>Faction Score = Total Siege Score obtained by all players in the Faction + Occupation Score\n\n<font color=0x00ff00>[Faction Switch]</font>In Faction Clash, players can use Secret Letters in War Room to switch Faction. A player can only join or switch Faction once per day. After a Faction switch, the player’s Season Clash Score will be reserved but the Clash Score of that Round will be reset to 0. When a players switch his Faction, his/her garrison in the original Faction stronghold will be removed immediately. After the Faction switch, the Last Round Ranking for that player will be the Ranking for his/her current Faction</font>",
